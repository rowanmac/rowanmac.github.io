*A unordered dump of different digital humanities projects that I find fun, interesting or useful (all of the above really) not necessarily related to Irish history. I try to update it whenever I find something new.*

- [The Teletext Museum](https://teletext.mb21.co.uk/) Website archiving the history of teletext with examples from all over the world.
- [Viabundus](https://www.landesgeschichte.uni-goettingen.de/handelsstrassen/map.php?lat=54.02351987047388&lon=18.654785156250004&z=6) A map of early modern European roads covering the north Germanic area through to the Balkans and a hint of Russia at the edges, focusing on trade and mobility.
