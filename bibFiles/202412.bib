These restrictions were the primary cause of the 1794 ‘mutinies’. These events, alongside other incidents of poor discipline across all ranks, have been previously used to portray the fencibles poorly. This article will argue that the ‘mutinies’ and the wider interactions within the military justice system both demonstrate the ‘soldier as worker’ approach and how the inherent temporary nature of the fencibles fundamentally shaped the employment of fencible officers and men.},

  abstract = {The Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood (FMDM) arrived in Ireland in 1942, to establish and run Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, county Galway. This was not without its challenges and this article explores many of those challenges in the context of the construction and management of the hospital between 1942 and 1970. FMDM sisters were women in a patriarchal church and needed to also negotiate their place within the similar frameworks of the medical profession, civil service, and government, while being subject to gossip as to the work they were doing. The article is a revealing case-study of some of the global changes in medicine that had been taking place since the 1920s. It is also an example of how modern methods of healthcare were having an impact on the Irish healthcare system, with medically trained Catholic religious sisters at the forefront. The story of women religious in twentieth-century global Catholicism is a relatively unattended one. This case-study allows historians of religion to better understand the internationality of Catholic religious congregations, examining concepts of unity and disharmony, and the various efforts they made to confront but also comply with the patriarchal structures in which they found themselves.},

  abstract = {Highlights the contested nature of higher education in the British Atlantic world between the Reformation and the EnlightenmentUniversities in the early modern period were powerful institutions in the formation of societies, utilised as both tools to legitimise and perpetuate the power of states and archetypes upon which to model an idealised society that might maintain social order. In an era of upheaval and civil war, rival authorities clashed in the universities, where the conflicts and complexities of early modern state formation were regularly laid bare.The encroachment of the Stuart monarchy beyond England into Scottish and Irish academe stimulated broader resistance from Scottish and Irish authorities, while prompting the founding of institutions of higher learning among expatriate communities beyond the British Isles, especially in New England. In these spaces, universities were viewed as institutional bulwarks against external intrusions that promoted localised, competing visions of the godly church and state amid the conflicts and complexities of early modern state formation.This book provides new insight into the contested nature of higher education in the British Atlantic world between the Reformation and the Enlightenment and corrects outmoded notions about the universities' purported insularity and intellectual poverty. Rather, the image that emerges of these universities is one of genuine academies of strategic importance, employed to serve the agendas of ruling powers in Scotland, Ireland, and New England. Trinity College, Dublin, Harvard College, and the Scottish universities existed on the frontiers of a deteriorating composite monarchy with a centralizing impulse, becoming battle grounds of the mid-seventeenth-century's intellectual, political, and religious conflicts.SALVATORE CIPRIANO is Associate Director of Career Coaching and Education, Stanford University.

  abstract = {Dutch society was taken aback by the onset of an apparently religious war in Northern Ireland at the end of the 1960s. It responded by initiating community holidays which they targeted at those children who were identified as being most affected by the Troubles. These community holidays aimed to ameliorate ‘otherisation’ by exposing Catholic and Protestant children to each other in a neutral, peaceful setting. This study examines the context and operation of these community holidays with a specific focus on three community holidays in the Dutch province of Zeeland between 1973 and 1975, the first of which was organised by Stichting Hulp Noord-Ierland (Foundation Help Northern Ireland, HUNI). The success of this initiative in achieving its aim of reducing prejudice and thereby future violence is assessed through a review of contemporary media material, organisational archives and interviews with witnesses from both the Netherlands and Northern Ireland.

From at least the mid-nineteenth century to 2018, we find that the Irish in England have persisted as an underclass, being on average 50 percent poorer than the English. Infant mortality was about 25 percent higher for the Irish between the 1830s and the mid-twentieth century but has subsequently equalized. Sorting, both to urban areas and to the North of England, are important elements in the Irish experience.

  abstract = {During the nineteenth century, local officials sought to deal with their Irish pauper ‘problem’ by removing these poor migrants back to Ireland under the laws of settlement and removal. Over the course of the century, hundreds of thousands of Irish paupers were forcibly repatriated in this way. Even though the settlement rights of Irish immigrants gradually improved over time, removals were still taking place into the twentieth century. The system was widely recognised as being cruel and unfair, especially in Ireland where the removal of Irish paupers from Britain garnered considerable political and press attention. Much was made of the illegality of some removals, and of harsh removals involving widowed women, children and the elderly. This book, which is the first sustained study of repatriation from Britain, demonstrates a persistent theme: the marginal nature of Irish life on the larger island. Drawing on extensive research from newspaper sources and parliamentary papers, it presents an original and richly detailed perspective on Irish immigration, poverty and pauperism in nineteenth-century Britain.},

While this accord concerned the Allied Powers of World War One and the entity we now know as Turkey, talks regarding its approval by Dublin had far-reaching consequences, on the right of dominions to refuse calls to arms from London and touched upon the issuing of Irish passports, which distinguished between British subjects and Irish citizens.

It argues that the Free State adopted a strategic and tactical approach, not as a technicality to fulfil their Anglo-Irish Treaty obligations, but out of a genuine desire for national union. The North-Eastern Boundary Bureau distributed publicity demonstrating the wishes of the inhabitants and outlined international comparisons. Officials visited Northern Ireland and Britain to ascertawin the views of stake-holders. The suggestions for creating all-Ireland institutions as an alternative to the commission show that the Free State leaders were motivated by a desire for ‘national union’. The dissemination of publicity internationally, the bureau’s role in applying for League of Nations membership, and the registration of the treaty at Geneva challenged potential British claims that the boundary was a domestic matter and demonstrates consideration of a potential appeal to the league.},

These global changes could be categorised under three headings: actors, issues and systems. Interviews were conducted with serving Irish dip- lomats to obtain \textbackslash{} their insights on, and assessments of, the increased com- plexity and widening scope of Irish diplomacy. It was found that the DFA was strongly influenced during the period 2000–2020 by international trends in the practice of diplomacy, including the proliferation of state and non- state actors conducting international relations, and the blurring of the dis- tinction between foreign and domestic policies. From an operational perspective, developments in information and communications technology and the rise of public diplomacy also had a major impact. A further key development in the Irish case was the significant growth in the size of the department in respect of both the number of missions and the number of staff. Over the twenty-year period under review, the department was required to adapt to both the evolving international context and to major internal organisational change."},

  abstract = {In the late twentieth century, Irish poetry achieved an historic quality, a golden era to compare with the verse of the Elizabethan and the Romantic periods. A Poet’s Life is the definitive biography of one of the first and foremost poets in this golden generation, John Montague. Inspired by the examples of Yeats and Joyce, he consciously educated himself to play a central role in the self-understanding of his people.~Ahead of the public recognition of such issues, Montague wrote personally about abortion, divorce, alcoholism, domestic violence, and clerical abuse in education. His poetry offered to others release from a painful past. Out of where he was most hurt, his best work issued. When the Troubles erupted in his home province, he was to the forefront in engaging with events directly, sometimes in a cross-community effort with fellow poets of the other faith. This record of his life is also an intimate, familial account of modern Irish poetry and its precision, documentary basis, and reliable chronology, it is sure to become a vital conduit into a body of poetry that will never be forgotten.~Already a highly lauded biographer, Adrian Frazier was a close acquaintance of Montague for more than forty years. In this fully authorised narrative that is clear, candid, and marbled with humour, Frazier reveals the sources of poetry in Montague’s life and traces the progress of his style from book to book. Based on Montague’s archive of private papers, and informed by the counsel of the poet’s lifelong friends, partners, and fellow poets, this is a monumental work of Irish literary biography, sure to be a classic of the genre.},

Drawing from fifteen semi-structured interviews with women involved in Peace People and other organisations, the study highlights how these women navigated ethnic identity politics and militarism to promote inclusive peace initiatives. Using Elisabeth Porter’s concept of the Politics of Compassion as a framework, the research illustrates how solidarity and empathy served as powerful political tools for these peacebuilders, enabling them to transcend gendered divisions and challenge prevailing power structures. Additionally, the article examines Transversal Politics, demonstrating how grassroots women skilfully navigated conflicting identities and differences to foster diversity and inclusion. The research further explicates how these efforts not only questioned gender-based sectarianism but also illuminated the role of non-violent activism rooted in compassion and justice.},

The stone circles of Lough Gur, the Norman strongholds of Askeaton and Adare as well as King John's Castle, the Treaty stone, the Georgian quarter of Newtown Pery, Cleeves Factory, and Thomond Park all stand proudly within this landscape today as monumental testimony to the region's character, a place where the peoples of Ireland and Britain have clashed, meshed, and evolved into a distinctive whole. With such a vibrant cultural inheritance, it is hardly surprising that Limerick is also the home of one of the oldest and biggest of Ireland's local history societies, first founded as the Limerick Naturalists Field Club in 1892 and now the Thomond Archaeological and Historical Society (TAHS). This volume of essays on Limerick city and county has been put together in honour of Liam Irwin, retired Head of History in Mary Immaculate College and leading member of the society for forty years, by his many admirers and friends.},

Although he was a confidante of de Valera, Barton accepted the terms on offer in 1921. He voted for the document in both the Cabinet and the Dáil, recommending the treaty to the House in his Treaty Debate speech. Subsequently, however, he took the anti-treaty side in the Civil War.Although he was central to the birth of the nation, Barton has remained understudied and neglected. This first study of his life focuses on his role during the Irish Revolution, charting his political journey from a Unionist background, through Home Rule and Dual Monarchism, to Republicanism and his later anti-treaty stance. Using multiple sources, including extensive archival material, this book traces the life, times and legacy of a remarkable revolutionary.},

  abstract = {Many people have helped create Dublin's unique streetscapes. This book looks at the builders and their projects and draws on the extraordinarily rich photographic archive of one of Dublin's foremost construction companies, G. \& T. Crampton, as it explores the evolution of the capital from the Edwardian period to the late 1980s. These images show the changing approaches and fashions as the projects reflected a growing capital city during the twentieth century. The transformation of the city is considered, not just in terms of fine public buildings and impressive commercial premises, but also through many everyday structures providing for the housing, employment, education, entertainment and shopping needs of its citizens. Dublin changed greatly during the twentieth century. The city spread far beyond its old boundaries as suburban housing for all income groups was built, and the locations of industry and commerce also shifted in response. Naturally, the building industry responded to these changing circumstances, as revealed by these images, from the emphasis on quality housing for workers in the 1920s at Marino and Drumcondra, to the hospitals built using money from the Sweepstakes, or the modern office buildings of the 1960s. In photos taken during construction or shortly after its completion, we see the pristine buildings as they were imagined by their architects. Each chapter includes an overview of key trends and issues, as well as maps, photographs and explanations of individual building projects which serve to illustrate the discussion and demonstrate how the streetscape evolved through time.},

Maol Muire was an active participant in the war that started in 1641 in Ireland. The poet describes the hardship caused by the conflict and praises Maol Muire’s military efforts. An apologue compares him to Cú Chulainn fighting alone to protect Ulster. This is the only extant poem composed for Maol Muire. The poem is edited here from Stonyhurst College MS A II 20, with readings from Trinity College Dublin MS H 6. 7 (1411) and British Library MS Egerton 112. A diplomatic edition of the text from the Trinity College Dublin manuscript has previously been published in ABM (133).},

The intention was to ensure a numerical advantage for the Protestant population in the new Northern Ireland, sufficient to ensure a permanent unionist majority. The publication of the data from the 2021 census in Northern Ireland and the 2022 census in Ireland allows for an assessment of how the demography has changed over the past 100 years, and the extent to which the changed ratio of Catholics and Protestants calls into question the longer-term viability of Northern Ireland as a polity. The article goes beyond the Catholic–Protestant binary to look at the growth in numbers of those with other faiths and those with no religion, and the impact of secularisation on the island of Ireland.},

  abstract = {CARVED STONE MONUMENTS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION about early ecclesiastical networks, but only if the complexity of these networks is appreciated. These were intricate, overlapping and fluid entities, characterised not only by outright ownership but by different degrees of tenure and obligation, and an array of other less onerous but still meaningful relationships. Using Clonmacnoise-style cross-slabs as a case study, we show that even very simple and ostensibly uniform monuments can illuminate this complexity through systematic mapping, close scrutiny of subtle variations, and by interweaving multiple lines of evidence, both material and textual. Using the Digital Atlas of Early Irish Carved Stone (DAEICS), we present the first comprehensive analysis of the two cross-forms most closely associated with the site. The distribution of Type A slabs is interpreted as a material expression of Clonmacnoise’s pre-eminence in Connacht during the ‘long 8th century’. Within Clonmacnoise’s hinterland, Type B slabs (c ad 800–1100) are often on documented outlying estates, while some of the others may indicate additional landholdings. A minority are further afield, sometimes providing evidence that Clonmacnoise-trained carvers travelled 60 kilometres or more. Usually there is just one example per outlying site, and unlike their Clonmacnoise counterparts, they often lack an inscription. We suggest that, rather than standard grave-markers, they were monuments that allowed all those buried there to benefit at a remove from the special qualities of the cemetery at Clonmacnoise. Both these distant Type B slabs, and related monuments employing the same cross-form, tend to be found at sites that sought to associate themselves with Clonmacnoise but are notably absent from sites that claimed to be of equal or greater importance. Compared to the latter, and indeed within the wider Insular context, Clonmacnoise emerges as an outstanding example of how stone-carving could be used to shape relationships with subsidiaries and affiliates.},

  abstract = {Analogue and digital simulations have been used in conjunction with other pedagogical approaches and practices for decades now as research continues to evince the positive influence that they have on learning and social interaction. There is a wealth of historical games that aim to immerse players in a variety of era-defining epochs, with varying levels of abstraction and narrative arcs. However, there appears to be a dearth of games that focus on past events that are deemed too disturbing, too divisive, or too recent, especially those that occurred in an urban setting. Additionally, the geopolitics – if any – are backgrounded, as are the socio-economic structures of the people and places being represented. So, what contexts should we not model or simulate? What stories cannot – or should not – be told through this medium? And when is a historical period ‘too soon’ to be approached – especially when a simulation, a mere ‘game’, is the method of examination something so recent, so distressing as the Troubles of Northern Ireland? This article introduces the table-top narrative-based simulation, The Troubles,1 scheduled for publication by Compass Games LLC, to demonstrate that there is space for such titles designed with clear pedagogical aims and objectives, which augment the popular genre of historical gaming – historical wargaming in particular – and that there is much to benefit from simulations of this type which are interdisciplinary in nature, encompassing academic disciplines such as politics, history, languages, and ethics.},

Through qualitative research resting on individual and focus group interviews with 55 mothers who had lived through the Northern Ireland conflict, this book examines the gendered nature of coping with conflict and its aftermath in peace processes. Drawing on the idea of everyday life peacebuilding, it discusses how the family is located in the processes of social transformation in conflict-affected societies, and illuminates that mothers play central yet largely unnoticed roles in maintaining and restoring sociability in a conflict-affected society. The book illustrates that mothers have been hidden and underappreciated ‘everyday peacebuilders’, as well as hidden and trivialised victims of the conflict.},

Instead, Ciaran O'Neill here makes the case for a broader, more inclusive, and decentred approach that emphasizes transnational phenomena, a settler-colonial diaspora, and minority groups on the island. Through the lenses of 'power' and 'powerlessness', he demonstrates that the received historiographical wisdoms suffer from several misconceptions: on the one hand they misconstrue the nature of power and the powerful, perpetuating historical myths about the 'ungovernability' of Ireland. After securing the Union, the British state proceeded to govern Ireland with less and less certainty of ever persuading its citizens of its legitimacy. Despite all reforms and investment, there was a widespread sense that Ireland would never recover and be a willing partner in the Union. And on the other hand they take at face value the nature of the so-called 'powerless', ignoring the myriad ways in which marginalized and diasporic groups negotiated and asserted their agency during the Union period, influencing and transforming the powerful centre in the process. The result is an untraditional and thought-provoking reappraisal of Union Ireland that raises important questions about colonialism and resistance - of what it means to govern and be governed, and the long-lasting legacies of the spaces in between.},

  location = {New York London},
  abstract = {While the it-narrative, the thing-poem and thing theatre have been around for some time, the essay – which is often considered literature’s fourth genre – is still lacking its thing-subgenre. Yet, particularly British and Anglo-Irish literature display a long, albeit so far implicit tradition of texts that can be categorised as ‘thing-essays’: Starting with Jonathan Swift’s “Meditation upon a Broomstick” (1701) and continuing until today, these texts draw broader insights from the contemplation of a material item of daily life. This book provides the first theoretical conceptualisation of this genre. Bringing elements from essay studies and the New Materialisms together, it shows why the essay lends itself particularly well to literarisations of the personal relationships that people foster to everyday objects. While the idiosyncrasies of each essay show the versatility of thing-essays, the study also seeks to unearth changing attitudes towards things – and thus towards people’s material surroundings in general – throughout time. In order to account for such synchronic and diachronic differences in thing-essays, this study develops a typology of three modes via which things can be approached essayistically. In the book’s second part, this framework will be employed in close readings and historicisations of 14 thing-essays from 1701 until 2021. Ranging from satire to sentimental writing, from religion to consumerism, from class to gender differences, from feelings of nationality to exoticism, from the French Revolution to Freud and from art to everyday life, the stylistic and thematic broadness of these thing-essays ultimately shows the multifarious connections between human life and materiality.},

  abstract = {Immediately following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December 1921, the emergent pro-Treaty regime pursued a strategy to win the brittle loyalty of the IRA’s Northern Divisions. The Provisional Government publicly adopted a northern policy of deliberate ambiguity which allowed it to appeal to militarists and moderates alike. The precariously situated Northern IRA largely accepted the Treaty due to these clandestine appeals and promises of military aid. Aware that it must maintain an uneasy coalition of diverse constituencies, the Provisional Government’s policy evolved from one aligned with militarists to one aimed at non-violent co-existence with Northern Ireland.},

  abstract = {While the impacts of Irish emigration to America following the Great Famine of 1845–1852 have been well studied, comparatively little scholarly attention has been paid to the effects of reverse migration on Irish culture, society, and politics. Inspired by the work of historian David P. B. Fitzpatrick (1948–2019) and forming a companion to his final published work The Americanisation of Ireland: Migration and Settlement 1841–1925 (Cambridge, 2019), this volume explores the influence of America in shaping Ireland's modernisation and globalisation. The essays use the concept of Americanisation to explore interdisciplinary themes of material culture, marketing, religion, politics, literature, cinema, music, and folklore. America in Ireland reveals a late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Irish society that was more cosmopolitan than previously assumed, in which 'Returned Yanks' brought home new-fangled notions of behaviour and activities and introduced their families to American products, culture and speech. In doing so, this book demonstrates the value of a transnational and global perspective for understanding Ireland's history.},

  abstract = {This article examines governing tactics which, prima facie, seek to remove issues from political contestation, yet utilise democracy in doing so. It explores this tension through the case of the 1973 Northern Ireland border poll. In the context of escalating violence and entrenched political conflict, the Heath government announced the poll alongside direct rule to ‘take the border out of politics’. Although the poll was consistently framed in terms of depoliticisation, it was increasingly viewed by both the government and the public as a means to reassure the unionist community of Northern Ireland’s status in the United Kingdom. This attempt to reassure the unionists exposed the political character of the strategy, strengthening the nationalist boycott campaign. However, this article argues that in reconfiguring legitimacy for the United Kingdom, the poll temporarily defused unionist concerns and allowed the UK government to claim Northern Irish citizens had a democratic right to self-determination.},
