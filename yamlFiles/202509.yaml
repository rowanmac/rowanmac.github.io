  abstract: >-
    This article examines British propaganda policy in Northern Ireland from
    1969 to 1982. In contrast with largely successful and routine coercive
    efforts to counter insurgencies in British colonies, tried and tested
    propaganda initiatives presented British governments with a Northern Ireland
    problem: how to respond to civil unrest and an armed insurgent movement
    close to the centre of power when subject to legal and media scrutiny. The
    proximity of Northern Ireland and the affinity of its dominant constituency
    of unionists, loyal to Britain, combined to hinder the transfer and
    application of otherwise seasoned strategies of propaganda and information
    warfare. The available archival records reveal how Britain's benign neglect
    of escalating civil unrest in Northern Ireland precipitated a series of
    information failures, undermining the government's attempts to secure the
    'hearts and minds' of a fractured population relegated to the perimeter of
    British government priorities.

    During a robbery on 10 March 1844, 14-year-old servant Mary Doherty was
    murdered in a farmhouse near Culdaff, Co. Donegal. There was no doubt
    locally about the perpetrator's identity, but there was insufficient
    evidence against Daniel McKeeny, and he was eventually transported for a
    separate offence of sheep-stealing. Based on original research, this book
    reconstructs the world of a north Donegal village on the eve of the Great
    Famine to explore the approaches to justice taken by the local community and
    agents of the state, and examines the survival of the murder in local
    folklore to reflect on memory, remembrance and whose stories get to be told.

    The Revival in Irish Literature and Culture offers a wide variety of new
    work on the Revival and the ideals, attitudes and perspectives that animate
    it, from the late-nineteenth century to the present day. The contributors to
    the volume, each in their own fashion, explore the social, political and
    cultural expressions of revivalism in literature but also in film, music,
    dance, commemorations, museum exhibits, social movements, and political
    activism. The volume offers new perspectives on established figures and
    ideas as well as new research on forgotten or under-represented revivalists,
    particularly women, whose cultural and political activities were
    instrumental in forming the foundations of the Revival and whose ongoing
    involvement shapes revivalism in new social and cultural contexts. One of
    the most important thematic strands linking the chapters is the function of
    time-our understanding of the historical “sense of the past” but also the
    efficacy of new temporal frameworks.

  abstract: >-
    Understanding Jonathan Swift's medical and literary life   The Dean
    Disordered bridges biography and literary criticism to examine the chronic
    afflictions suffered by the great Irish satirist Jonathan Swift,
    investigating not only how these ailments affected his day-to-day social
    life and ambitions but also how he represented them in his correspondence
    and imaginative writings. By historicizing Swift's medical issues, Paul
    William Child returns the creator of the iconic character of Gulliver (a
    surgeon, notably) to the humoral body that he knew. Child situates Swift's
    complaints within the theory of illness as an imbalance of fluid humors that
    had persisted since classical days, considering how Swift tried to make
    sense of and contain his own humors through narrative explanation, medical
    interventions and regimen, performances in the 'sick role,' and imaginative
    representations. Rather than accepting modern diagnoses of Swift's
    illnesses, The Dean Disordered reconstructs the medical culture of his time.
    The book opens a window into Swift's experience of illness and prompts us to
    read both the man and his works anew.

  abstract: >-
    This book is a study of the print cultures of the four principal Celtic
    languages ― Irish, Welsh, Gaelic and Breton ― in the crucial period between
    1700 and 1900.Over the past four centuries, the Celtic languages of
    northwest Europe have followed contrasting paths of maintenance and decline.
    This was despite their common lack of official recognition and use, and
    their common distance from the centres of political power. This volume
    analyses publishing, circulation and reading in the four languages,
    particularly at a popular level, showing the different levels of overall
    activity as well as the distinctions in the types of printed texts between
    regions. The approach is a broad one, considering all printed books down to
    very small cheap formats. It explores the interactions between the different
    regions and the continuation of print culture within diasporic
    communities.This volume will appeal to book historians, to scholars of the
    four languages and their literature, and to students of Celtic studies.

  abstract: >-
    Painting History: The Murals of Northern Ireland, 1908–2024 is the first
    book-length study of the oldest and most enduring tradition of political
    wall art. Tony Crowley shows how muralism became an important medium for the
    unionist and loyalist community in its political domination of public space
    before and after Partition. The text also demonstrates that nationalists and
    republicans painted few murals before the start of the 1981 Hunger Strike,
    during which they painted wall art across republican areas of Northern
    Ireland as a way of publicizing their cause. In the context of a divided
    society, by the mid 1980s murals had become an established genre for the
    expression of political demands and aspirations. In Painting History, Tony
    Crowley provides a detailed analysis of the complex tradition of muralism in
    the context of the history that produced it, with particular attention given
    to the cultural politics of this remarkable form. The book also raises and
    discusses a series of theoretical questions about murals and muralism that
    transcend Northern Ireland: issues of propriety and legality, form and
    content, authority and censorship. The work ends with a consideration of the
    future of the murals in a still polarized but changing region.

  abstract: >-
    Ireland’s relationship with the British Empire has long interested scholars,
    although in its early stages Irish imperial studies focused largely on
    Nationalist opposition to empire or on debates over Ireland’s precise
    colonial or imperial status. Happily, in the past ten years or so a
    consensus has been reached that Ireland occupied a hybrid position, both
    colonial and imperial, which has in turn allowed more space for studies that
    explore the variety, depth and ambiguities of Irish imperial sensibilities
    and experiences. Fergal O’Leary’s new book is one such work, examining how
    empire was presented, understood and debated in Irish society during the era
    of the New Imperialism. O’Leary uses a series of topical studies grouped in
    three broad categories (Politics, Culture and Society) to chart the extent
    of Irish interest and involvement in empire as well as the ways in which its
    experiences and outlook differed from the rest of the United Kingdom. A
    central theme of the book is that Ireland in this period was simultaneously
    a colonial (or perhaps anticolonial) and imperial society that witnessed the
    growth of both nationalist and imperial/super-regional identities.

    Industrial Yarns Ltd, a large textiles factory and one of Seá n Lemass's
    flagship industrial projects, provided well-paid employment for hundreds of
    workers in Bray for many years. This contextualized study, charting the rise
    and fall of the company over forty years, is based largely on wide-ranging
    interviews conducted with twenty-three former workers. Their stories,
    spanning four decades, uncover the factory's working conditions, culture,
    social relationships, remuneration schemes, industrial relations history and
    its close ties with the local community. The book provides unique insights
    into what it was like to work in this remarkable enterprise.

  abstract: >-
    Explores medieval Irish interest in Classical mythology and historiography
    and how it could be situated within the framework of Christian salvation
    history.From allusions to the Olympians in seventh-century glosses to
    twelfth- and thirteenth-century vernacular adaptations of the epics of
    Vergil, Lucan, and Statius, Irish authors creatively re-imagined Greco-Roman
    mythology throughout the Middle Ages. They developed many strategies for
    situating the Classical deities within medieval Christian historiography,
    but rarely did they downplay or eliminate them. Some of these strategies, as
    this study reveals, reflected wider medieval European trends in Classical
    reception and mythography, whilst others were strikingly original and
    paralleled the ways in which Irish authors imagined the supernatural beings
    of their own pre-Christian past. This book examines why Irish authors were
    interested in the history and mythology of the ancient Mediterranean, and
    how Classical polytheism influenced their ideas about their own pagan past.
    It explores the ways in which depictions of Irish Otherworldly characters
    both shaped and were shaped by the gods and supernatural figures of the
    Classical adaptations. Based on close readings of texts such as the Irish
    version of Lucan, In Cath Catharda, this book argues that Classical
    scholarship in medieval Ireland was closely tied to medieval ideas about
    salvation history. Ultimately, it concludes that medieval Irish authors and
    audiences applied the same interpretive tools used for biblical exegesis to
    characters and events from Greco-Roman mythology, history, and literature,
    and to the supernatural inhabitants of pre-Christian Ireland alike.

  abstract: >-
    Mitchelstown in Co. Cork was one of over 750 Irish towns built or remodelled
    between 1690 and 1840. Its regular street plan, linear building plots and
    uniform architecture epitomized the enlightened and improving mentality of
    the period. The town was largely built over a period of fifty years between
    1779 and 1830, at a time of significant national and local economic
    expansion, creating opportunities for investors and builders to develop and
    speculate. This study examines not only the ambitions and influence of the
    proprietorial family, the Kings, earls of Kingston, who initiated the
    reconstruction of the town, but also those who engaged in building and
    developing it. These professionals, shopkeepers, clergymen and others had as
    much influence on its architecture and realization as had the proprietors.

  abstract: >-
    On 31 August 1994, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced a
    ceasefire. Over the previous two-and-a-half decades, it had waged western
    Europe’s most lethal and enduring insurgency, claiming the lives of over
    1,700 people. The IRA’s ‘armed struggle’ had been a key driver of ‘the
    Troubles’ that beset Northern Ireland; its decision to end the campaign of
    violence was likewise integral to an emergent peace process. Almost from the
    moment it was declared, commentators and historians have debated the IRA
    ceasefire. Why did it happen? What did it mean? Which side had blinked first
    in the long war between the British government and the IRA? In seeking to
    answer such questions, an emerging trend within the historiography aims to
    advance an understanding of the conflict that foregrounds IRA flexibility,
    as juxtaposed to British intransigence. On this reading, it was the British
    refusal to engage in dialogue and offer the IRA an ‘honourable’ settlement
    that prevented a peaceful resolution as far back as the early 1970s;
    conversely, it was the British decision to shift course in the late 1980s
    that paved the way for peace. The problem, however, is that such a narrative
    represents a fundamental misreading of what happened. For this reason, the
    present article examines several recent, important contributions to the
    literature on the IRA and the peace process, as part of an effort to revisit
    the question of why it was that the IRA decided eventually to end its
    self-declared ‘long war’.

    Old Irish law tracts provide valuable insights into the practice of medicine
    in Ireland during the early medieval period. While the focus of the law
    texts relating to medicine was predominantly medico-legal, with an emphasis
    on computing compensation for injury, an understanding of contemporary
    medical practice can also be inferred from such texts. Male and female
    practitioners used herbs and surgery to treat their patients and supervised
    nursing care with a particular emphasis on diet. Physicians also provided an
    all-important public prognosis for the patient. The nature of the injury,
    the probable outcome and the status of the victim determined the level of
    compensation to be paid by the guilty party. Practitioners were also
    sometimes called upon to adjudicate in intimate and marital affairs.
    Synthesising information gleaned from the Old Irish law tracts, this article
    provides a unique insight into medicine in early medieval Ireland in terms
    of the status of physicians, known medical knowledge and contemporary
    practice.

  abstract: >-
    Throughout the Twentieth Century many women in Ireland and Britain endured
    shame and institutionalisation for becoming pregnant outside of marriage. In
    this welcome study, Lorraine Grimes examines the journeys made by hundreds
    of pregnant Irish women to Britain as they fled to escape their local
    communities.Their experiences in Britain, however, were not free of stigma
    and Grimes’s book analyses the nuances of the institutional networks both in
    Britain and Ireland which these women utilised.Single Mothers in Twentieth
    Century Ireland and Britain focuses on the experiences of women from
    1926-1973 in cities with high Irish emigrant populations, including London,
    Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow. Unlike official narratives such as
    Ireland’s Commission of Investigation into the Mother and Baby Homes, this
    book prioritises the experiences of the survivors and ensure that women’s
    experiences are central to the narrative. It also incorporates original
    interviews with children born in institutions and for the first time,
    interviews with religious and medical staff are also included in the
    historiography.Using archival research and oral history, Grimes reveals the
    methods British and Irish institutions developed, from forced adoption to
    repatriation and the impacts of this on the women and children’s lives.
    Grimes makes a significant contribution to the historiography surrounding
    the movement of women and children across international borders through
    repatriation and adoption between institutions on both sides of the Irish
    Sea. From extensive archival research, this book reveals cases of Irish
    single mothers seeking assistance in Britain as well as cases of rape,
    incest and domestic violence within the institutional records. In addition,
    archival cases expose prejudice towards women from other colonial countries
    in institutions in Britain, particularly from the 1960s. A first for the
    field, Single Mothers includes a chapter on the experiences of single
    fathers. Sensitive to the underlying issues of class and gender politics,
    the book also shows that women often enacted a large degree of agency to
    improve their situation.If you are interested in women’s political and
    social history, and the history of the institutional relationships of
    Britain and Ireland, this book is essential reading.

  abstract: >-
    Among the many ephemeral publications printed in Dublin at the height of the
    Wood’s halfpence affair is the anonymously authored A Letter from the Grand
    Mistress of the Female Free-Masons to Mr Harding the Printer (Dublin: John
    Harding, 1724). This was one of many satires of the Freemasons published in
    the early 1720s. Its framing references to Wood’s halfpence locate it in
    relation to that affair, and its imaginative, if satirical, representation
    of a female society can be situated in relation to other accounts of
    fictional female clubs of the early century and to discussions of women’s
    exclusion from Freemasonry in particular and from club culture more
    generally. The pamphlet is known to survive in only one copy but despite
    this ephemerality, its participation in the dynamic world of relatively
    popular, cheap print in Dublin in the 1720s reveals much about the nature of
    print culture and ideas of gender in this period. The essay uses its
    readings and contextualizations of the pamphlet to argue that print hoaxes
    and gender play – common comic modes in early eighteenth-century print
    culture, and particularly in ephemeral pamphlets and broadsheets – permitted
    ideas about women’s roles and possibilities to be imaginatively explored. A
    transcription of the Dublin 1724 printing, with a brief discussion of the
    question of its authorship, follows as an appendix.

    David (Davy) Rees, a London-born actor, quickly endeared himself to Irish
    audiences when he appeared on the Dublin theatre scene in November 1830. His
    career flourished as a comedian, with Irish audiences embracing his talent
    for low comedy—a demanding genre—requiring not only acting skills, but also
    the ability to sing and dance. Michael Booth describes the low comedian as a
    ‘farce actor … who was energetically ludicrous or phlegmatically droll, and
    the helpless victim of chance and misunderstanding’, a description that
    perfectly fits Rees’s style. Excelling in this role, Rees established a
    unique rapport with his audience. His comedy relied on simple, yet
    effective, gestures—a well-timed wink or a specific action that could send
    spectators into fits of uncontrollable laughter. Contemporary accounts
    highlight his extraordinary ability to leave audiences ‘convulsed with
    laughter’ and maintain the theatre ‘in continuous roars of laughter’ so
    intense that spectators ‘laughed until [they] forgot what [they] came for’.
    These qualities exemplified the essential traits of successful comic actors
    of the period, and Rees embodied them with remarkable skill.

    However, Davy Rees’s legacy as an actor transcends his comedic performances.
    His career serves as a valuable lens for understanding the complexities of
    performance art within its historical context. His life and work encompass
    historical, cultural and social dimensions that are essential for
    understanding Ireland’s theatrical heritage. Rees’s story provides insight
    into early nineteenth-century Irish theatre, its audiences, the challenges
    faced by performers and managers and the theatre’s pivotal role in
    reflecting and shaping the cultural values of the era.

    Ireland’s accession to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973
    provided great opportunities, as well as significant challenges to its
    relatively small civil service. This book traces Ireland’s internal
    adaptation to managing membership. The long wait for accession to the EEC
    had instigated administrative and management patterns during negotiations
    which were difficult for Ireland to untangle and alter afterwards. There was
    friction between departments on how to approach relations with the EEC in
    some policy areas after membership. At times, this effectively slowed and
    even hampered Ireland’s adaptation to membership. At the same time, the EEC
    provided an important new frame of reference for Irish society. Discussions
    on social progress drew from that wider context and challenged Ireland in
    new ways. This volume explores this development through an analysis of
    empirical files from the National Archives of Ireland and the Historical
    Archives of the European Union, newspapers, and secondary sources.This book
    is intended for scholars and students of Irish history, European Studies,
    political science, diplomatic studies, and administrative history.

  abstract: "This book illuminates the often-overlooked story of early modern Irish women, particularly those from the Protestant colonial community. Drawing from aristocratic, gentry, farming, business, and trade families, these women were shaped by the religious and intellectual currents of their time. Raised within the Church of Ireland or the Church of England, as adults they were enriched by European influences of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation:\_ Swiss and Dutch Calvinism, Gallicanism, Jansenism and the spirituality of Port Royal.The book explores how these women engaged with Renaissance Humanism, the early French Enlightenment, and cultural discussions on topics such as pre-existence, 12th-century Arabic culture, Judaism, and the Lurianic Kabbala. Central to their lives was Reformation spirituality, which fostered literacy, critical thinking, and personal faith through vernacular Bible readings and church services.Despite living in patriarchal societies that largely relegated women to subordinate roles, these women demonstrated remarkable resilience and intellectualism. The book highlights their struggles and triumphs, showing how they navigated and sometimes resisted the constraints imposed on them. By focusing on their narratives and voice, the book reveals the courage and agency these women exhibited in shaping their own destinies and laying out their legacies.Through detailed biographical accounts, the book restores these women to their rightful place in history, offering a nuanced understanding of their contributions and the broader social and religious contexts in which they lived. Researchers and general readers with an interest in women's history, gender studies, and early modern Irish history will find this a useful addition to those fields."

    Cené l nEó gain, a royal dynasty from Inishowen in Donegal, defeated its
    previously more successful opponent, Cené l Conaill - also from Donegal - at
    the battle of Cló itech in AD 789. All changed following that battle. From
    then on, the Cené l nEó gain kingdom, known as ' Ailech', spread across
    Counties Derry, Tyrone (giving that territory its name), into Armagh, and
    dominated the whole territory of Ulster. It also attained, alternately, the
    higher kingship of Tara. After surnames appeared c.1000, the Mac Lochlainns
    and O' Neills became Cené l nEó gain's leading families. Meanwhile, the
    defeated Cené l Conaill struggled to maintain some degree of prestige
    following the emergence of a previously minor, upstart kingdom, originally
    from west Donegal, the Sí l Lugdach. By c.1200 the O' Neills and the leading
    Sí l Lugdach family, the O' Donnells, were in position to rule the whole of
    Ulster until the English conquest c.1600. This book outlines in detail how
    that situation came about.

  abstract: >-
    Sir Charles Wogan (1684–1754) was rewarded for engineering the rescue of
    Clementina Sobieska in 1719 with a colonelcy in the Spanish Army and spent
    most of his active career as a soldier in garrisons in Northern Spain. So
    far as is known, his only experience of combat and, more particularly,
    experience in command in an action, was in 1732 during the Spanish Oran
    campaign. The purpose of this article is to explore that part of Wogan’s
    military career, focusing upon one incident in the Oran campaign in which
    Wogan played a leading role but which led to the termination of his active
    involvement in the campaign because of a wound that he received during the
    incident and, ultimately, led to his decision to cease active service until
    his military career revived in 1745, when he was promoted to
    brigadier-general and put in command of a contingent of Irish officers sent
    to France to join Prince Charles Edward Stuart.

  abstract: >-
    Bryan MacMahon focuses on human stories rather than statistics as he depicts
    the unprecedented events, upheavals and challenges of the famine years
    through the eyes of those who were there and reveals information which has
    lain hidden and untapped for 170 years. This book gives an account of
    incidents in Tralee and North Kerry. It gives a detailed overview and a
    moving insight into the suffering endured by thousands in the area. The
    contemporary accounts allow the reader to relive the shocking events, and to
    understand the stark dilemmas faced by those who were not themselves
    directly affected by hunger or disease. Here too are the names and inquest
    details of some of the dead, and poignant descriptions of life in the
    workhouses of Tralee and Listowel. Included are stories of scandals and
    possible sexual abuse in the workhouse but also many examples of selfless
    humanitarian work.

  abstract: >-
    A ballad about a woman street trader is widely regarded as Dublin's anthem,
    yet the city's relationship with those who traded on its streets was often
    acrimonious. From 1882 onwards efforts commenced to have street traders
    banned alongside gentrification projects. A watershed came with the passage
    of the Street Trading Act of 1926. This book examines the resistance of the
    traders when those with power refused to recognize them as stakeholders.
    What the establishment learned was that the women were prepared to engage in
    civil disobedience, endure violence from Gardaí and serve time in jail to
    both protect their livelihoods and protest what they characterized as '
    banishment to the slums' .

    This book explores the workings of the Cork Street Fever Hospital in
    Dublin's south-western quarter in the decades after its opening in May 1804.
    The foundation of the hospital, its significant role with the wider
    international fever hospital movement, and its management and financial
    structures are discussed, as are the experiences both of medical staff
    (physicians, apothecaries and nurses) and of patients. Through case studies
    of the fever epidemics of 1817- 19 and 1826- 7, this book demonstrates that
    in ' normal' times and in times of crisis, the Cork Street Fever Hospital
    was central to efforts in curtailing the progress of contagion in Dublin
    city.

    The Republic of Ireland lived under one of the strictest abortion bans in
    Europe for decades, then in 2018, their voters passed one of the most
    liberal abortion provision schemes in the world.Pills & Protest: Abortion
    Access in Ireland tells the story of how feminist activists strategically
    used abortion pills to help people while abortion was illegal and to
    influence the legal and medical changes to come. Drawing on three years of
    interviews with activists, doctors, and politicians in Ireland, Brenna
    McCaffrey illuminates the story of how the abortion pill transitioned from a
    controversial object to a legally recognized medical solution. The result is
    an energizing story – one of creative protest, passion, and activism in
    pursuit of reproductive freedom. Pills and Protest demonstrates how
    understanding medication abortion is essential to understanding reproductive
    healthcare in Ireland – and globally – today.

  abstract: >-
    Scholarly attention within the field of documentary cinema in the last
    twenty years or so has developed a new branch of studies often focused on
    what is termed the essay film. This mode of expression commonly associated
    with post-war filmmakers such as Alain Resnais and Chris Marker frequently
    seeks an appropriate mode of address to come to terms with a traumatic past.
    This essay endeavours to bring some of the insights of critics on the essay
    film, such as Nora Alter, Timothy Corrigan, Philip Lopate, and Laura
    Rascaroli to an Irish context. In particular, the essay films by Peter
    Lennon and Mark Cousins are discussed as best seen and understood within
    this new context. It is argued that these films seek to unburden the
    suffocating effects of Irish history and serve as a kind of medication for
    past and ongoing injuries. An effort is also made to build an admittedly
    imperfect genealogy of the Irish essay film by reaching back to the 1940s
    and referring briefly to the work of Liam O’Laoghaire and subsequently
    George Morrison in the early 1960s.

    The list presented here forms a promptuarium or brief repository of detail
    on the poets, writers and scholars from the territory historically known as
    Thomond (Tuadhmhumhain). The list is neither exhaustive nor complete, but
    rather is a circumscribed enumeration of entries that draw from references
    in the annals, manuscripts and prose texts. The list is presented here in
    chronological form and entries are restricted to summary details of chief
    literary works, the location of scholarly individuals (if known) and other
    relevant particulars. The purpose of presenting this list is to aid the
    general reader and researcher alike in identifying individuals who
    contributed to the classical Irish literary tradition from the early
    medieval period to the beginning of the twentieth century. The compilation
    of lists of Irish poets and scholars has a long pedigree and can be traced
    to medieval author-lists. While much labour has been expended on past
    endeavours to produce a comprehensive listing of the literati of Ireland,
    what is attempted here is a more limited endeavour. The scope of this list
    is confined to the literati of Thomond and whose literary work—or whose role
    as manuscript custodians, scribes or amanuenses—contributed to, or in some
    way helped forward, the classical Irish literary tradition. This list stands
    as a modern contribution to the venerable tradition of listing the Irish
    literati and their works.

    This article examines Irish women who acted as agents for the exiled Stuarts
    between 1689 and 1724, focusing in particular on the question of women’s
    political allegiance and their motivation to take deliberate political
    action. It argues that the categorization of ‘women’ as a collective is
    inhibitive, as it fails to account for a plurality of circumstance and
    experience, including social status, economic status, ‘nationality’, and/or
    ethnicity, time period, and geographical location. It also recognizes that,
    for similar reasons, the application of collective identity is inhibitive in
    exploring the history of Jacobites and Jacobitism. By focusing on individual
    acts of identification, as opposed to a singular political identity, it is
    possible to understand loyalty to the Stuarts as existing on a spectrum,
    with the few who committed acts of treason on the upper end of that spectrum
    and the many who could be described as less active on the lower end. In
    taking this view, it is possible to identify links between active and less
    active Jacobites, and to recognize opportunities for movement from relative
    inactivity to instances or periods of activity, particularly in response to
    episodes of war or rebellion. The significance of gender in the context of a
    subversive and often treasonous movement is explored throughout. The case of
    Catherine Lucas is used to interrogate the importance of gender and existing
    social infrastructure in facilitating the treasonous activities of women
    agents and in providing such women with a measure of protection.

    'The best book about Irish politics you can read ... O'Malley has produced
    one of the finest books ever written about modern Irish politics' - William
    Stephens, Gript'A rattling good read' - David McCullagh, RTÉ'A fantastic
    read' - Hugh Linehan, Irish TimesThe two opposing political figures that
    shaped Irish life in the 1980s and beyond.In the 1980s, Irish politics was
    dominated by a fierce rivalry between Charles J. Haughey and Dr Garret
    FitzGerald, both leaders of their respective parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine
    Gael. Between them they each led all Irish governments in that decade; to
    say their two opposing personalities shaped Irish life during this era is an
    understatement.Eoin O'Malley has amassed an extraordinary body of research,
    including in-depth interviews with dozens of the most consequential public
    figures of the time, every Taoiseach, cabinet ministers, TDs, civil
    servants, and advisers.As political rivals with different approaches to
    public life and contrasting visions for Ireland, each enshrined in quite
    different personalities, the choice between Haughey and FitzGerald came to
    signify a great deal more than party loyalty or policy preference: it felt
    like a choice between opposing worldviews. And, as O'Malley's work finally
    makes clear through an accumulation of extraordinary insights, including
    interviews with Haughey and FitzGerald themselves, it was fed by a deep
    reservoir of personal insecurity and paranoia. Each was deeply preoccupied -
    obsessed even - with the strengths, appeal and threats of the other, to the
    extent that this rivalry itself became one of the decisive factors in Irish
    life that shaped Ireland well after they had left power.

    Díríonn an t-alt seo ar naoi ndán pholaitiúla le hÉadbhard de Nógla. Is é
    aidhm an ailt solas a chaitheamh ar dhearcadh polaitiúil an Nóglaigh agus an
    chaoi ar léirigh sé a thuiscint ar imeachtaí polaitiúla ó na daichidí go dtí
    na hochtaidí san ochtú haois déag. Ní chuirtear a dhánta ar Chogadh na
    Seacht mBliana san áireamh sa phlé seo, áfach, toisc go bhfuil siad sin in
    eagar ag údar eile cheana féin. Pléitear ceithre dhán ar Shéarlas Éadbhard
    Stíobhart agus ar chúrsaí polaitiúla na hEorpa, chomh maith le dán amháin ar
    Chogadh Quebec i Meiriceá Thuaidh. Déantar plé anseo ar amhrán grá agus
    polaitiúil ar Mháire Treasa, Banríon na hOstaire, den chéad uair. Ag tús na
    1770idí chum an Nóglach dán polaitiúil ina bhfuil macalla de stíl an fhile,
    Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin, mar aon le hamhrán macarónach a léiríonn scil an
    fhile sa dá theanga. Scríobh de Nógla aisling pholaitiúil amháin ag deireadh
    a shaoil ina léiríonn sé a dhílseacht don Seacaibíteachas agus a thugann
    tuiscint ar leith dúinn ar a chumas mar fhile. Déantar scrúdú ar an aisling
    sin mar chuid den aiste seo, chomh maith.

    In this study, using the words of both the land agent, William Rochfort
    (1847- 1940), and the tenants on the Lismore (O' Callaghan) estate in
    Counties Cork, Limerick and Tipperary, the land agent- tenant relationship
    between 1891 and 1902 is explored. The techniques employed by Rochfort to
    investigate the personal circumstances of his tenants, his treatment of them
    and his ability to occasionally provide discreet assistance to those in need
    are all examined. Issues of most concern to the tenants, as told in their
    own words, are considered.

    The National Gallery of Ireland holds a portrait by Jean-Baptiste Perronneau
    (1715–83) entitled Portrait of a Man and dated 1766. By cross-referencing a
    number of material and historical clues, it is shown that the man portrayed
    is none other than Jean-Gabriel Montaudouin (1722–81), a shipowner from
    Nantes, Physiocrat and slave trader, author of a memoir of agriculture,
    arts, and commerce (1756), which served as a model for the French
    agricultural societies of the late eighteenth century.

    Irish composer Eoghan Desmond’s cantata Amra Choluim Chille (2019) sets the
    blind poet Dallán Forgaill’s eulogy in praise of St Columba, which is
    thought to have been written after the death of the saint in ce 597.
    Premiered by Chamber Choir Ireland in March 2023, the work for choir,
    strings, harp and percussion makes a significant contribution to
    Irish-language choral repertoire and represents the only complete
    choral-orchestral setting of this text. Although the piece is solely in the
    Irish language and contains elements of traditional musical idioms, the
    music is not bound to the traditional style, instead drawing on historical
    and contemporary musical influences to bring Columba’s story to a modern
    audience. Desmond’s melodic motifs, textural and modal structures, and
    symbolic devices suggest a deep understanding of Dallán’s text, and the
    purposeful synthesis of ancient and contemporary musical styles. This
    article explores the key compositional techniques that bring the ancient
    poem to life, focusing on Desmond’s significant use of the St Columba hymn
    tune, traditional musical features and symbolism, as well as his combination
    of historical and contemporary musical processes, to convey the sacred
    narrative in a compelling musical manner.

    aistriúchán le Niall Ó Domhnaill ar Commando: A Boer Journal of the Boer War
    le Deneys Reitz, agus An Aifric Theas (1947), bunleabhar faisnéise le

    nuair ba ann go fóill do dhearcadh rómánsúil in Éirinn faoi na hAfracánaigh
    a thug dúshlán impireacht na Breataine ag tús an fichiú haois; agus, in An
    Aifric Theas, an cuntas finné súl ar an Afraic Theas sna 1930idí le húdar a

    This article looks at military history through a social lens, focusing on
    the identity and experiences of the Irish Catholics recruited for service in
    the British army during the American Revolution, a conflict which occurred
    before Catholics were legally permitted to serve, but during which
    significant numbers were recruited nonetheless. Using Irish Catholic
    recruitment and subsequent service in the 46th Regiment of Foot as a case
    study, this article will discuss the integration of this group into a
    regular regiment on the British establishment, arguing that despite
    contemporary anxieties to the contrary, the incorporation of Irish Catholics
    into the British army happened smoothly and without negative impact on
    regimental cohesion and discipline. They became well-integrated, and while
    their loyalty to the British state can never be definitively proven, they
    certainly became effective participants in its army and empire. This
    provides a compelling viewpoint from which to discuss the integration of
    ‘others’ into Britishness and the imperial apparatus during this period.

    In the last thirty years, Ireland has been the most successful country in
    Europe in using Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to bring employment and
    prosperity to its economy. Using low rates of corporation tax and the
    up-skilling of its labour force, as well as drawing on strong cultural
    connections with the United States, it has been able to attract a range of
    largely American multinationals to build industrial sectors focused on
    exporting into the European Single Market. Today around half of all
    manufacturing employment in the country is in the hands of such companies.
    But this successful policy mix was a long time in the making, and in this
    book, Frank Barry traces its roots back to the foundation of an independent
    Ireland and through to the crucial decision to enter the European Common
    Market, along with Britain and Denmark, in 1972.

  abstract: >-
    This article offers a new way of framing the English conquest of Ireland by
    focusing on the development of a kingdom of Ireland both before and after
    the invasion of 1169. It thus spans the historiographical divides that tend
    to partition Irish history at the point of the English invasion, and which
    also frequently disaggregate the study of British and Irish history. By
    exploring the complexity of Irish political society and culture before 1169,
    one can see how King Henry II sought to use its structures to facilitate his
    annexation of ‘the kingdom of Ireland’ in 1171–2. This included the Church,
    which offered Henry’s dynasty the ideological support and legitimacy it had
    once provided for Gaelic kings of Ireland. Paying attention to the numerous
    references to the ‘kingdom of Ireland’ in the records of the English
    government also highlights the processes by which Henry’s son John and his
    successors sought to Anglicise this kingdom by imposing England’s laws,
    institutions and political culture upon it. Crucially, ultimate control of
    these structures remained with the administration in England, so in this way
    Ireland was transformed from a kingdom to a colony. Recognising this liminal
    period in the development of Anglo-Ireland provides context for the emerging
    colonial community in Ireland, as well as strategies of resistance and
    compromise employed by the Gaelic Irish under English rule.

    David Trimble was one of the most influential figures in modern British and
    Irish history. A Nobel Laureate, he negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in
    1998 that helped to secure peace in Northern Ireland.In this first biography
    to chart Trimble’s life and death, award-winning journalist Stephen Walker
    vividly details how this shy Belfast academic changed the political
    landscape of Northern Ireland. With the cooperation of the Trimble family,
    Peacemaker offers unparalleled insights into the life of a history maker:
    the first person to be elected First Minister of Northern Ireland and the
    last Ulster unionist to hold that title.Using interviews with his widow Lady
    Trimble and their grown-up children, the book colourfully charts Trimble’s
    story from the County Down city of Bangor, through the divisive world of
    unionist politics, to his crowning moment at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony
    in Oslo. It is a tale of how the leaders of unionism and nationalism worked
    together to end decades of violence to compromise and share power.

    This book looks at the people of Meath during the turmoil of the
    revolutionary era. As politics, war and revolution intruded on daily life,
    some embraced the chance for change, risking life and livelihood for their
    chosen cause; others resisted the tide. But for most the responsibilities of
    work and family, getting the children out to school and worrying about
    money, were more pressing concerns. The upheaval of the years from 1912 to
    1923, however, gradually affected the regular round of shopping, sport and
    socializing. This book looks at life in Meath as national and international
    events drew closer to home and the future looked ever more uncertain. While
    not at the centre of the fighting, the county suffered the long anxiety
    brought by terror - the terror of conscription, of the isolated killing,
    ambush and reprisal. More intense bursts of violence, such as at Ashbourne
    and Trim, terrified some and radicalized many. Meath's unique location,
    touching both Ulster and Dublin, produced local patterns of political and
    revolutionary involvement, while older tensions over land flowed just below
    the surface. But this was also a time of social and technological revolution
    bringing exciting new opportunities, especially for women. Using local
    newspapers and recently released records the author tells the story of the
    revolutionary years in Meath, keeping the people's experience always in
    focus.

  abstract: >-
    This article revisits Jonathan Swift’s Proposal for the Universal Use of
    Irish Manufacture (1720) and seeks to place it within the context of the
    debates surrounding the proposed establishment of an Irish national bank in
    1720. It shows how Swift’s discussion of the ills facing the Irish economy
    might be placed in conversation with the projects for a bank. In doing so it
    both takes Swift’s commentary on the bank seriously and speculates that it
    may have been an addendum to the original text of the pamphlet. Engaging
    with recent Swift scholarship and the literature on the bank it shows how
    the dean’s arguments fitted into wider arguments and the economic future of
    a dependent province and how these debates were fundamentally shaped and
    reshaped by the wider context of the South Sea Bubble.

  abstract: >-
    Thomas Moore has long been considered Ireland's national bard and the face
    of colonial grievance in Ireland. But he also grew up in a port city and
    then travelled with and worked for the British Navy. Dubbing himself
    'transatlantic Tom', Moore rode and wrote about the currents of the north
    Atlantic and coastal locations key to naval operations and trade routes.
    Following Moore on these lines of motion allows us to trace local and global
    circuits, including literary networks, agricultural trade, interests in the
    Atlantic fishery, migration, military activity and the coercions of the
    slave trade. Powered by water, such motion pulls against the fictions of
    stable, bounded property necessary to the British Empire and influential in
    British Romanticism. Moore not only transits Irish Romanticism and British
    Romanticism: he is also a window onto a sea-level view of the Romantic era.
