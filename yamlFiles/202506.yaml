    This article is drawn from a broader research project exploring Irish wakes,
    funerals, and the specialists who make these rites of passage possible. My
    thanks go first to the many undertakers, embalmers, gravediggers, coffin
    makers, monument carvers, crematorium operators, clergy, and civil and
    humanist celebrants across Ireland who have taken the time to speak with me
    and let me observe them in action. This article would not have been possible
    without the perspectives and patience of Colin Mc Ateer, Martin Boyle, Harry
    McGrenaghan, and Tiernan Roulston. I offer special thanks to them and also
    to Reverend Jo Mc Ateer, Olivia Owens, Jason Baird Jackson, Emily Bianchi,
    Fionnán Mac Gabhann, and Ryan Lash for multiple insights and forms of
    assistance. Except where noted, the photos are by the author.

    The historical consensus on Cumann na mBan, Ireland’s republican women’s
    organisation, suggests that by the period of the Second World War (or
    Emergency as it was known in independent Ireland) it was largely inactive.
    This article explores the organisation’s activity in this period, framing it
    as part of the group's post-revolutionary afterlife. Through consideration
    of Cumann na mBan's records, state records from the Department of Justice
    and newspaper material this article considers the work of Cumann na mBan and
    other republican women in support of prisoners and their dependents. This
    article also discusses how existing republican feminist networks, forged
    during Ireland's revolution, remained central to this prisoner support work
    throughout the Second World War. It considers how republican women had
    agency and ownership of a significant area of republican activism through
    welfare work. It also discusses how Cumann na mBan's status as an auxiliary
    to the IRA was contentious from its foundation and remained so throughout
    this period.

    Italian and Irish immigrant experiencesWhen people migrate, they often
    perform social and cultural rituals along the way. The idea of rites of
    passage—with its elements of preparation, departure, transit, admission,
    exclusion, expulsion, and return—help us understand these moments in the
    process of migration in new and meaningful ways.Rituals of Migration offers
    snapshots of Italian and Irish migrants on the move from the mid-nineteenth
    to mid-twentieth centuries. The essays in this volume examine the particular
    moments, actions, sentiments, and material objects in the process of
    migration—at the point of departure, in transit, and in the process of
    return. Because rites and rituals feature both nonverbal and verbal
    expression, migration history can be understood by studying physical objects
    as well as written sources. The authors focus on rituals created by migrants
    and their descendants, but they also consider the actions of officials who
    regulated migrants’ departure, travel, admission, exclusion, and removal. By
    examining what people did, thought, felt, and packed on the eve of their
    departures, during their journeys, and when returning to their homelands,
    Rituals of Migration reveals how everyone involved in the immigration
    process, including the migrants themselves, the families they left behind,
    and those in charge of regulating their mobility, have tried to make sense
    of a process filled with peril, uncertainty, excitement, and opportunity.

    This article investigates how the role of archival texts as agents of memory
    requires memory scholars to expand the concept of agency beyond human
    agency. Revisiting Aguilar’s and Budrytė’s concept of human individuals as
    ‘agents of memory’, it draws on actor–network theory, colonial archive
    studies and book history to track the shifting ‘memory capital’ of forgotten
    archival texts. Taking as its case study the jail writings created by female
    prisoners during the Irish Civil War, the article contends that taking into
    account archival texts – as well as their creators – as agents of memory can
    provide a richer understanding of how cultural memory is created, stored,
    forgotten and – sometimes – reanimated in the wake of national conflict.

    This book examines the history of a pioneering Thoroughbred horse breeding
    operation, the Irish National Stud. By incorporating and integrating a
    diverse array of primary sources from various repositories and supplementing
    them with contemporary and secondary materials, the main narrative reveals
    the intricate details of Ireland’s complex relationship with Britain through
    sport and politics. The publication adopts a chronological, thematic
    approach, beginning at the turn of the nineteenth century and tracing the
    development of the Stud through the twentieth century and into the
    twenty-first century.This book encompasses the political, cultural, and
    social dimensions of horse breeding/racing and the role of what would become
    the Irish National Stud. The first period of its history covers the
    establishment of Tully Stud in Kildare under Colonel William Hall-Walker in
    1900. The second period, from 1916 to 1944, begins with Hall-Walker
    ‘gifting’ Tully Stud to the British government, which then rebranded it as
    the ‘National Stud’. This coincided with the Irish independence struggle and
    the formation of the new Irish Free State, leading to over two decades of
    deadlock over which government—Irish or British—legally owned the Stud. The
    third period saw the progression of the new Irish National Stud, from its
    creation in 1944 to the present day, offering a comparison with the British
    National Stud and providing a thorough analysis of the influence of elite
    Thoroughbred breeders on the Irish National Stud and the broader industry in
    both Ireland and Great Britain.

    Luxury items bought in nineteenth-century London’s fashionable West End, and
    the time spent browsing there, were examples of conspicuous consumption.
    This article uses a case-study of 200 bills to explore the shopping
    preferences of Mary Anne St Leger, Viscountess Doneraile, a member of the
    Irish peerage who lived during the years of the class’ most dramatic
    decline. Building on consumption studies, I argue that Doneraile’s shopping
    practices, and her preference for London over Irish suppliers, were an
    exercise in ‘quiet luxury’ as she used her cultural capital to make
    discerning choices. She curated her membership of Britain’s social elite
    through London-bought goods.

  abstract: >-
    From 1945 and into the 1950s in Ireland's economic history has been
    described as post-war recovery and gloom and doom respectively, leading to
    the 1960s golden age. However, despite this gloomy outlook, with some delays
    attributed to the Emergency, a ‘quiet revolution’ kicked off in late 1946.
    That revolution was the Rural Electrification Scheme (RES) of the
    Electricity Supply Board of Ireland, a scheme designed to bring electric
    power to every village in Ireland. While some academic research has
    addressed the RES, detail on specific locations and effects is lacking,
    which is surprising given the effects the scheme had on life and economy in
    rural Ireland. Drawing on archival evidence, existing history texts, media
    and some oral histories, this paper explores the story of the first village
    to receive power under the RES, namely the village of Oldtown in County
    Dublin. This story is largely untold, and in particular, why this village
    was the first is explored. The benefits of electric power to rural homes and
    farms are also detailed. In the case of farming, early shoots of today's
    thriving tillage and horticultural activity typical of North County Dublin
    are apparent.

  abstract: >-
    From small beginnings running a glazing and house-painting business in
    Mountmellick, later members of the Star family became master-painters and
    wallpaper manufacturers in Dublin between 1820 and 1880. In Mountmellick,
    they were Anglicans with a Quaker clientele; in Dublin, a new generation
    became Catholics, serving a Catholic clientele and specialising in church
    decoration. Their story highlights both possibilities and problems in
    operating a business in nineteenth-century Ireland. It also gives a new
    angle on aspects of Ireland's ‘devotional revolution’, the nature of Irish
    nationalism and limits to Dublin's industrial development. Building on both
    historical and genealogical research, a look at one family business suggests
    how other families and their histories, in similar economic and social
    settings, could be described and analysed.

    This paper examines the occurrence of bishops of Irish dioceses among the 

    grantors of so-called ‘collective indulgences’ at Avignon between 1322 and
    1363 

    and attempts to demonstrate how these indulgences can facilitate our
    knowledge 

    of the episcopate in Ireland during the fourteenth century. Over 140
    references 

    to Irish bishops have been collected and are discussed, along with twenty
    occurrences of bishops from Scotland for the same period, plus a handful of
    Scottish 

    and Welsh bishops named in indulgences from the late thirteenth century.
    The 

    paper discusses the nature of the Avignon collective indulgences and uses
    these 

    documents to help reconstruct the movements and careers of the Irish
    prelates 

    in question. The second part of the paper offers a more detailed
    consideration 

    of the controversial bishopric of Annaghdown during the first half of the
    fourteenth century, in the light of the testimony of the indulgences. This
    case study 

    also highlights problems relating to the collective indulgences as primary
    sources 

    themselves, including their reliability. An appendix listing the occurrences
    of 

    Irish and Scottish bishops in collective indulgences is provided, arranged
    by diocese, and additional data about individual bishops is provided there.

  abstract: >-
    Between 1621 and 1626, the soldier-historian Philip O’Sullivan Beare
    authored treatises to motivate Catholic powers toward greater intervention
    in Ireland, and to defend his country’s honor more generally. Moving beyond
    political theology, the author’s unfinished manuscript Zoilomastix
    incorporated natural history and astronomy. The current article draws
    attention to a previously overlooked fragment wherein the Irishman
    considered contemporary debates on the structure of the heavens. It first
    considers the material history of the fragment, before exploring the
    influence of continental pedagogic and military networks upon the author.
    The paper then presents evidence of O’Sullivan Beare’s adherence to Thomist,
    Bellarminian cosmology, and of his disagreement with Clavius and Galileo,
    via Jacques du Chevreul’s 1623 commentary on Sacrobosco’s Sphere.
    Contrasting the fragment’s contents with the cosmogony published in the
    author’s Patritiana decas (1629), it demonstrates that these exegetic
    readings were part of the author’s wider strategy for “making truth” amidst
    shifting political, confessional, and cosmological paradigms.

  abstract: >-
    An absorbing study of the development and reception of musical culture in
    Ireland by a pioneering and deservedly renowned author. This volume is a
    collection of fourteen essays on the history and reception of Irish music
    and music in Ireland. It addresses three prevailing themes: the
    historiography of Irish music, the influence of music on Irish writing (and
    vice versa), and the cultural identity and reception of Irish music both
    domestically and in the world at large. Its principal protagonists include
    Thomas Moore, W. H. Grattan Flood, George Moore, Edward Martyn, Charles
    Villiers Stanford, James Joyce, Dora Pejačević, Ina Boyle, Aloys Fleischmann
    and Jennifer Walshe. These essays also identify and interrogate key
    questions underpinning a general crisis of reception in relation to Irish
    music, and particularly art music, within the domain of Irish studies.
    Fieldwork examines this crisis in the aftermath of The Encyclopaedia of
    Music in Ireland (published in 2013) and a major retrospective of Irish art
    music, Composing the Island (curated and presented in 2016). It thereby
    engages closely with contemporary Irish art music and the challenges which
    this music has faced in the early decades of the twenty-first century. This
    well-conceived and beautifully written work testifies to Harry White's
    central place in the shaping of the discourse surrounding the cultural
    history of Irish music over the last 40 years. White's gift for expression
    and memorably poetic turns of phrase allows the complexity of ideas and
    range of historical and literary knowledge examined in these essays to be
    deftly excavated and evaluated. Curiosity, provocativeness, imagination and
    literature are threaded through his exploration of how Irish history and
    experience have been imagined musically.
