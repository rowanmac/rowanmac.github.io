    This book investigates the history of the Protestant voting blocs and
    associations in the Irish border counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan,
    from 1920 to 2016. While there are many studies on the history of Irish
    Unionism and Protestantism, there has been a lack of research concerning the
    political history of the Protestant community in the border counties
    following partition. Many Protestant Unionists in counties Cavan, Donegal,
    and Monaghan felt betrayed by their six county counterparts breaking the
    Ulster Covenant in abandoning a nine-county Northern Ireland. However, the
    Unionist Associations of these counties evolved after the implementation of
    the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 and adapted to their new political
    environment by becoming ‘Protestant’ Associations. The author seeks to
    explore how these Associations were established, and how they reacted to
    political changes during the twentieth century. Arguing that Protestant
    Associations arose as a Unionist shock response to Ireland’s partition in
    1922, the author demonstrates how they aimed to ensure their political
    representation and the maintaining of Protestant interests. Support for
    these associations dwindled over time due to demographic change, a decline
    in membership of the Orange Order, and the gradual erosion of Southern
    Protestantism as a separate political identity over the course of multiple
    generations. Shedding light on why these associations lasted until the
    twenty-first century, and then disbanded, this book examines how former
    Southern Unionists in the border counties evolved their political identity
    following partition.

  abstract: |-
    What makes a historical event and, more particularly, what makes
    it memorable? Addressing this question in a Victorian context, a
    time of obsessive preoccupation with memorialization and
    commemoration, the essay considers the case of the Great Irish
    Famine, with comparative reference to other contemporary notable
    events. It argues that scale alone—even when it impacts the lives
    of millions of people—is not sufficient for attaining prominent
    historical recognition and that the conditions for major
    occurrences to be remembered in public may depend on narratability
    (with reference to how they can be related to familiar narratives
    of previous events), mediation (through journalism and literature),
    and politicization.

  abstract: >-
    This article traces the contours of the history of women’s education in
    England and Ireland in the period 1850-2000, mapping dominant themes and key
    inflection points. Positing a framework for reading degrees of change over
    time, we propose four interrelated lenses: access, curriculum, institutional
    presence, and networks. Drawing on key contributions to the field, we argue
    that women’s engagement with higher education has followed a complex and
    uneven trajectory, reflective of the shifting sands of attitudes and
    accommodations toward women across time, space, and discipline.

  abstract: >-
    The topic of urban revolt in medieval Ireland has been overlooked by wider
    scholarship. This article offers the first detailed analysis of a revolt
    which occurred in Galway in the late fourteenth century. The basis of this
    study is a twentieth-century transcription made of an extract from a plea
    roll of the king’s bench in Ireland before the latter’s destruction in 1922,
    which records the judicial proceedings taken against one of the town’s
    rebels and provides an under-exploited (and not entirely reliable) narrative
    of the key facts of this rebellion. This article locates the actions of
    Galway townspeople within a wider European pattern of protest and rebellion
    in the second half of the fourteenth century and, more specifically, places
    the revolt in the context of contemporary political events in Ireland and
    England. The events in Galway should be viewed as a genuinely ‘popular’
    revolt, challenging assumptions about the presumed loyalty of towns and
    cities in medieval Ireland to the English crown and its local
    representatives.

    This article examines some early medieval Insular texts on the ideal king:
    three examples of Old Irish tecosca (wisdom) texts and the ninth section of
    the Latin De XII abusivis (‘On the twelve abuses’). These texts are
    collectively much studied, but largely from a perspective of the ideology of
    rulership they espouse, be it Christian, pre-Christian or secular. This
    contribution takes an alternative perspective, underlining the techniques
    the authors used to construct a common elite identity, encompassing both
    rulers and other lay and clerical elites.

    A century after the state's foundation, Ireland faces an acute homelessness
    crisis with families and children increasingly affected. This book uncovers
    how decades of housing policy, financial decisions and social factors have
    shaped today’s housing insecurity. It is the first to take a historical
    approach, tracing the roots of homelessness back to key policy decisions
    taken over the past century.  By understanding how we got here, it offers
    crucial insights into breaking the cycle. Essential reading for policy
    makers, scholars and anyone concerned about Ireland’s housing future, with
    lessons for other jurisdictions, this book reveals why solving homelessness
    requires rethinking how we build and fund housing.

  abstract: >-
    It was by chance that John Morrogh (1849–1901) became an imperial player.
    Leaving Ireland as an almost penniless young man moulded by the Catholic
    nationalism of the Christian Brothers, he joined the early diamond rush to
    Kimberley, South Africa, and returned home twenty years later a director of
    Cecil Rhodes’s De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines. He joined the Irish
    Parliamentary Party (IPP) and his diamond fortune eased his path to a seat
    in the House of Commons. As the IPP fragmented, he took the side of the
    anti-Parnellite, Tim Healy, until he resigned his seat and returned to Cork
    where he became an influential figure in business and local government. This
    article traces the fortunes and sensibilities of an Irish migrant who in
    many ways exemplifies Ireland’s ‘ambivalent heritage’ of nationalism and
    empire.1

    The article charts the changing fortunes of the Catholics of Lisburn, County
    Antrim from 1914–22. It begins by exploring the establishment of a local
    battalion of the Irish National Volunteers and analysing Catholic
    recruitment to the war effort, before turning to the Easter Rising (1916),
    its aftermath and the bitter sectarian riots of August 1920, following the
    assassination of RIC District Inspector Swanzy. This murder in the centre of
    Lisburn led to days of violence and forced many of the town’s Catholics to
    flee. This paper argues that relations between nationalists and unionists in
    the 1914–22 period should be understood in the context of unionist beliefs
    regarding their communal safety and that territorial security is key to
    understanding the presence and form of violence in the town during the
    Swanzy Riots. Finally, some consideration is given to how this case study of
    Lisburn offers insight into understanding communal violence elsewhere in
    Ireland, during the wartime and revolutionary period.
