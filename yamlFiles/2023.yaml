    In Thomas Drew and the Making of Victorian Belfast, Farrell analyzes the
    career of “political parson” Thomas Drew (1800-70), creator of one of the
    largest Church of Ireland congregations on the island and leading figure in
    the Loyal Orange Order. Farrell demonstrates how Drew’s success stemmed from
    an adaptive combination of his fierce anti-Catholicism and populist
    Protestant politics, the creation of social and spiritual outreach programs
    that placed Christ Church at the center of west Belfast life, and the rapid
    growth of the northern capital. At its core, the book highlights the
    synthetic nature of Drew’s appeal to a vital cross-class community of
    Belfast Protestant men and women, a fact that underlines both the success of
    his ministry and the long-term durability of sectarian lines of division in
    the city and province. The dynamics Farrell discusses were also not confined
    to Ireland, and one of the book’s central features is the close attention
    paid to the ways that developments in Belfast were linked to broader
    Atlantic and imperial contexts. Based on a wide array of new and
    underutilized archival sources, Thomas Drew and the Making of Victorian
    Belfast is the first detailed examination of not only Thomas Drew, but also
    the relationships between anti-Catholicism, evangelical Protestantism, and
    populist politics in early Victorian Belfast.

  abstract: "The origins and evolution of Irish American identity, from colonial times through the twentieth century \_ “Subtly provocative. . . . [Meagher] traces the making and remaking of Irish America through several iterations and shows the impact of religion on each.”—Terry Golway, Wall Street Journal \_ As millions of Irish immigrants and their descendants created community in the United States over the centuries, they neither remained Irish nor simply became American. Instead, they created a culture and defined an identity that was unique to their circumstances, a new people that they would continually reinvent: Irish Americans. \_ Historian Timothy J. Meagher traces the Irish American experience from the first Irishman to step ashore at Roanoke in 1585 to John F. Kennedy’s election as president in 1960. As he chronicles how Irish American culture evolved, Meagher looks at how various groups adapted and thrived—Protestants and Catholics, immigrants and American born, those located in different geographic corners of the country. He describes how Irish Americans made a living, where they worshiped, and when they married, and how Irish American politicians found particular success, from ward bosses on the streets of New York, Boston, and Chicago to the presidency. \_ In this sweeping history, Meagher reveals how the Irish American identity was forged, how it has transformed, and how it has held lasting influence on American culture."

  abstract: >-
    Most of the literature concerning the momentous challenges facing Irish
    American Catholics in the first two decades of the twentieth century pay but
    scant attention to the role played in addressing them by the American
    Church. Among the myriad political, social, cultural and economic issues
    confronting Irish American Catholics none stand out as prominently as the
    unabated burden of combatting scurrilous attacks upon them by nativist
    forces, the task of proving themselves as loyal American citizens, and
    navigating the perilous waves in advancing the course of directing Irish
    American nationalism and the cause of Ireland's freedom. Patriotism is a
    Catholic Virtue ferrets out the impact the institutional Church played in
    affecting the course of action Irish American Catholics took regarding these
    three crucial missions. Whereas the task of confronting the assaults of
    nativism, seemingly the natural task for the institutional Church, this
    study provides extensive evidence of the relentless defense of Catholic
    virtue conducted by diocesan newspapers. Similarly, the mission of promoting
    Catholics as loyal American citizens was largely left in the hands of the
    American hierarchy, its clergy, newspapers and Catholic societies and
    affiliates. Lastly, this book provides evidence that the Church may well
    have played the decisive role in guiding its Irish American faithful along
    paths that, while conservatively promoting Irish nationalism, did not
    jeopardize an "American First" policy for Catholics. All of this was
    accomplished in the crucible of an emerging worldwide war.

    Abstract
                This book examines how the strategic problem of containing threats of religious war and violence shaped political culture and the development of the state in Britain and Ireland between Elizabeth I’s last serious courtship and the death of James VI and I. In doing so it shows how the religious politics of England, Scotland, and Ireland were thoroughly intertwined with each other, and with developments on the European Continent, requiring a treatment that moves beyond a framework of national history by connecting events in different countries in a continuous narrative. Specific topics covered include the interaction of religious and dynastic politics not only in relations between royal families but also among the nobility and gentry; efforts by the Elizabethan state to contain threats of Catholic rebellions; the often fraught relations between the Elizabethan regime and James VI in Scotland; cultural attitudes related to military entrepreneurship on both land and sea; challenges to Protestant state power in Ireland; English intervention in the wars of the Netherlands; the interplay between English and Scottish conflicts over Presbyterianism in the 1590s; efforts to create a more integrated and effective state encompassing all of Britain and Ireland after 1603; and the European policies of James VI and I.
