  abstract: >-
    The continental recension of the vita of the sixth-century Irish saint Íte
    survives only in five independent manuscript witnesses of the Magnum
    Legendarium Austriacum [MLA], a vast, sprawling collection of hagiographical
    texts culled from a great variety of sources in the late twelfth century.
    The recension is anonymous in all five witnesses, but internal and
    circumstantial evidence points to Paul of Bernried (c. 1080 - c. 1145) as
    the reviser of this vita. Paul was an Augustinian canon best known for his
    Life of Pope Gregory VII (1073-85) which also survives in the MLA. The most
    likely reason for his interest in this early Irish saint is the affinity he
    saw between her and the Bavarian holy woman Herlucca of Bernried (c.
    1060-1127/8) whom he knew and revered. Although separated by space and time,
    Íte and Herlucca provided a common spiritual model that resonated with Paul
    despite his support for a Gregorian reform movement tainted by misogyny.

  abstract: >-
    Originally given as the Eolas Lecture at the International Congress on
    Medieval Studies at Kalamazoo in 2023, this exploratory essay poses two
    overlapping questions: did medieval Irish intellectuals think about "ethics"
    (as distinct from "morality," say, or "law") in ways that can be traced in
    our surviving sources; and what are the ethical standards to which we might
    hold ourselves in medieval Irish studies, as a modern academic discipline,
    in relation to issues such as publication, reviewing, our approach to
    sources, and how we interact with each other? Ethics, as a philosophical
    sub-discipline, encompasses many aspects of human behavior, past and
    present, and this essay suggests that it is essential, both individually as
    scholars and collectively as a discipline, to think about how we can write
    ethically, review ethically, and participate ethically in academic life. It
    also argues that we can indeed see a strand of thinking about ethics in
    medieval Ireland, and that further work is required to disentangle it from
    other established frameworks for understanding the actions of individuals.

  abstract: >-
    Through a selection of essays from a variety of scholarly voices, this
    volume maps the various ways in which Shakespeare has been adapted, adopted
    and appropriated in Ireland from the late 17th century through to the
    present day. Shakespeare's plays have been performed in Ireland since the
    1660s, when Smock Alley theatre was established in Dublin, with Shakespeare
    serving as its essential stock-in-trade. Since then the playwright's work
    has played a central role in the formation of Irish culture. His works
    helped to fashion colonial identity in Ireland in the 18th century and
    beyond, but, from the 1800s onwards, Shakespeare also became an important
    figure for Irish nationalists.In the modern period, Shakespeare’s influence
    can also be discerned in the work of a broad range of Irish writers, and
    this volume considers the impact of his plays on such authors as Synge,
    Joyce, Beckett and others. The volume also explores the place of Shakespeare
    in the Irish theatrical tradition.Shakespeare in Ireland explores the
    history of Irish Shakespeare through the numerous ways in which the
    playwright and his work were reconfigured and recycled in various Irish
    contexts. The volume demonstrates how Shakespeare has been rendered Irish in
    a variety of complex ways, and it aims to track, over time, the story of how
    Shakespeare became a fully hibernicised figure.

  abstract: >-
    This article examines Catholic architecture in Ireland prior to the passage
    of An act for the relief of His Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects (10 Geo
    IV, c. 7), popularly known as the Act of Emancipation, in 1829. It focuses
    on one case study building — the chapel, now church, of St John the Baptist
    in Cashel, County Tipperary. Bringing together a range of documentary and
    visual sources, this building is analysed according to its site, its
    specific architectural stylistic features, and in relation to the social and
    liturgical contexts for its development. The article contributes to the
    ongoing reassessment of the impact of the penal laws and the varied
    experiences of Catholics through the late eighteenth-century period of
    relief and reform, through its spatial, formal and contextual close reading
    of one hitherto overlooked building. In doing so, it deepens understanding
    of how architecture was used as a statement of civic identity and political
    intention by Catholics of status and means. It also contributes to
    contemporary understandings of regional classicism and to the specific
    meaning of ecclesiastical architectural style in late-eighteenth-century
    Ireland across denominations. Finally, this article considers the treatment
    and ‘strategic forgetting’ of this period of pre-1829 Catholic building
    activity during the era of grand architectural expansion at the end of the
    nineteenth century.

  abstract: >-
    By examining how Irish racial attitudes intersected with national and
    cultural identity, this article dismantles the idea that conceptions of race
    and racism are somehow peripheral or irrelevant to the nation's social
    history. Outlining a series of racialised incidents perpetrated against
    overseas students in mid-twentieth-century Ireland, it explains how
    attitudes to newcomers and ethnic ‘others’ can shed new light on
    post-independence national identity. By highlighting these distinctive
    aspects of national discourse, this article begins incorporating Irish
    understandings of race and diversity into the overwhelmingly white field of
    Irish history. It also adds an Irish perspective to a growing body of
    literature on race in predominantly white societies and challenges scholars
    to consider how conceptions of history, culture and identity fostered social
    inclusion and exclusion and conditioned attitudes to national and ethnic
    outsiders.

    This article explores the Department of Education's programme of
    co-operation and rationalisation within the Irish post-primary school sector
    during the period 1966–70. Through a systematic analysis of government files
    and private convent archival collections, especially those of the
    Presentation Sisters, combined with oral history interviews, this study
    provides a unique insight into how co-operation and rationalisation in the
    post-primary sector were reconciled at ground level. It exposes the
    previously hidden history of voluntary secondary school authorities and the
    role they played in educational reform during the 1960s and explores how
    individual school authorities received, responded to and reacted to this new
    government initiative. To a large extent, the success of co-operation and
    rationalisation depended on the willingness of school authorities to accept
    and comply with departmental directives. This study, thus, expands
    understandings of the history of the Irish education system in general and
    of the reform period (c.1957‒72) in particular.

  abstract: >-
    Recent scholarship has revealed the extent of eighteenth- century debates
    about the salience of honor in a rapidly modernizing Britain. However, Maria
    Edgeworth’s contributions to these debates have not been recognized, perhaps
    because of the uneven and disputed modernization of her adopted home,
    Ireland, with its three competing eighteenth- century “honor worlds.”
    Ireland’s shifting and contested eighteenth-century honor discourses shape
    and misshape the text of Edgeworth’s Castle Rackrent and its authorship,
    narration, reception, and paratext. Initially resolved by inculcating the
    emergent Irish Catholic middle class with modern honor principles through
    the narrative actions of a novel bardic poet narrator, Thady Quirk, the text
    ultimately undercuts its own resolution of the problem of modern Irish
    honor. Instead, because of her own potential loss of honor, effected by the
    1801 Union with Great Britain, Edgeworth subverts the bardic work of her
    character-narrator in her novel’s paratext. Ironically, Edgeworth’s honor
    and that of her family would be restored by the favorable reception of the
    very text that attempted to resolve the issue of the modern salience of
    honor in Ireland and then rejected its own resolution.

  abstract: >-
    Patrick’s purgatory in Lough Derg, Donegal, is one of the great medieval
    pilgrimage sites. On the extreme edge of Europe, it physically embodied the
    theological idea of purgatory, offering pilgrims a this-worldly encounter
    with its horrors. Despite Protestant efforts to destroy it, it survived the
    Reformation and posed a classic challenge for Protestant and Roman Catholic
    historians. For the latter, it exemplified the continuity of Catholicism in
    Ireland from Patrick to the present, a living embodiment of the unchanging
    loyalty of the Irish people to their national saint. For Protestant
    historians, it was, like purgatory, a twelfth-century invention, revealing
    both the medieval corruption of the Roman Catholic Church as it added
    non-scriptural embellishments to the Christian faith, and the superstition
    of Irish Catholicism. The interaction, and tension, between theological
    belief and historical objectivity was to prove a persistent challenge for
    both sides, right down to the twentieth century.

  abstract: >-
    Assessing the impact of paramilitary violence on border Protestants in
    Northern Ireland remains a critically overlooked part of the region’s
    history. Remembered through a framework of memory that blurs the boundary
    between victim and perpetrator, existing scholarship often disempowers
    border Protestants by obscuring their experience under the Provisional IRA’s
    campaign. This re-examination of the conflict illuminates how the Troubles
    impacted the Protestant community’s physical, economic, and cultural
    presence in the border counties. Combining oral history with a broader
    assessment of the Provisional campaign, this book presents a compelling case
    study for viewing this violence as a form of ethnic cleansing.

  abstract: >-
    This article uses inventory evidence for the possessions of households in
    later fifteenth-century County Dublin, an area largely characterised by
    rural settlement. Because household goods are often only indifferently
    recorded, its focus is less on individual cases than on larger patterns of
    consumption between social groups. In particular, by making comparisons with
    inventories from later medieval England and from the wine-growing Gers
    region of south-west France in the mid fifteenth century, it explores both
    how far evidence from County Dublin fits within and helps suggest wider
    European ‘peasant’ and ‘bourgeois’ patterns of consumption. By extension it
    explores the boundaries between the urban and the rural and how far a hybrid
    suburban identity can be discerned. In some cases a combination of close
    reading and statistical analysis is used to recover occupational identities,
    something that the source does not specifically record. The significance of
    the material culture of specific households is examined in two instances —
    one that of Lady Margaret Nugent, a wealthy and devout widow living in
    Dublin's St Michan's parish, and the other that of a couple who managed an
    inn located next to one of the city gates.

  abstract: >-
    This article examines Irish nationalist girl scouts in the period 1911‒23
    with a particular focus on the organisation Clan na Gael (or Clann na
    nGaedheal). It illuminates the involvement of girls in Irish nationalist
    youth organisations in the early twentieth century and situates them in the
    wider contexts of uniformed youth groups and the Irish nationalist movement
    during this period. Like their male counterparts in Na Fianna Éireann, Irish
    nationalist girl scouts received forms of military training and provided
    military support services to their adult colleagues in the Irish
    independence movement. Thus, these Irish girls challenged the gender
    conventions of the time more overtly than members of the international Girl
    Guide movement. Participation in these groups could also serve as a conduit
    to future membership and activism in Cumann na mBan or the Irish Citizen
    Army. The contributions of Clan na Gael and other girl scouts to the Irish
    nationalist movement demonstrate that girls, as well as boys, sought to
    further the struggle for Irish independence. Yet, these adolescent female
    activists have received far less recognition for their efforts. This may be
    due to their relatively small numbers, dismissive preconceptions of their
    contribution, and the sparsity of primary source material.

  abstract: >-
    How do borders define political, cultural and social realms, influencing
    identity and community? Mind the Gap: Borders, Limits and Frontiers explores
    such questions and comprises two parts; the first section compiles
    interdisciplinary essays from leading scholars to critique borders in our
    global yet divided world. Topics include national borders, such as the
    Northern Irish border, as well as conceptual and ontological borders more
    generally. Border issues are similarly key to the second part of the book,
    which publishes for the first time the imprisonment memoir of Irish
    politician Cahir Healy (1877–1970), who was a leading figure in the protest
    against the Partition of Ireland. His memoir offers a first-hand account of
    the conditions faced by Healy and other border objectors who were illegally
    imprisoned for two years on board the Argenta ship in Belfast Lough
    (c.1922–1924). This book therefore goes beyond mapping border theory; it
    addresses the real-life impact of borders on those who confront them daily
    and is a vital read for those interested in border studies.

  abstract: >-
    In 1610, just over fifty men were granted hundreds of thousands of acres of
    land as part of the estates allocated to English undertakers in the Ulster
    Plantation in the counties of Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh and Tyrone.
    Exactly who these individuals were and why they were given estates remains
    understudied. This article closely explores the process whereby lands were
    petitioned for by consortiums of individuals in 1609 and early 1610, before
    assessing who, from amongst the well over 100 applicants, were actually
    granted lands. Where possible, it considers the background of many these
    individuals, their ties to the court and officials in England and Ireland,
    and their material resources. It also highlights how the applicants for
    lands who had the greatest financial means to make a success of it were
    generally ignored in favour of petitioners whose ability, from a material
    perspective, to implement the articles of plantation was highly dubious,
    something which many senior officials, such as the viceroy of Ireland,
    Arthur Chichester, had been anxious to avoid.

  abstract: >-
    The late-eighteenth-century 'age of revolutions' has long been identified as
    a key moment in the gendering of modern democratic politics, one which
    opened up new debates on the 'rights of women' while often re-affirming the
    masculinity of the political citizen. In Ireland, the revolutionary era saw
    the rise of the radical United Irish movement, mass popular mobilisation,
    and reached a violent dénouement in the 1798 rebellion. But what did
    Ireland's age of revolution mean for women? Was radical republicanism able
    to imagine women as political actors? How did Irish women experience and
    navigate the intense ideological conflicts of the 1790s? Addressing these
    and related questions, this is the first book-length study of women and
    Irish politics in the late eighteenth century. Revising a stubborn tendency
    to present women's political engagements in this period as largely mediated
    through men, it stresses instead women's concerns, initiatives, and
    networks. It reconstructs the distinctively gendered political cultures of
    Ireland's principal communities–the dynastic politics of the Protestant
    elite; the dynamic oppositional culture of Belfast Presbyterianism; the
    urban and agrarian radicalism of unpropertied Catholics–and asks how these
    shaped the meanings of the 1790s for women. In looking beyond the homosocial
    spaces of the club, pub, lodge, and corps, it reveals a complexly gendered
    public sphere in which women were often active participants. As the subjects
    of United Irish addresses, religious sermons, state surveillance, and
    post-rebellion commemoration, women emerge as a clear, if overlooked,
    constituency in Ireland's age of revolution. And it suggests how our
    understanding of revolution might change when viewed from the perspective of
    women.

  abstract: >-
    ‘Nations,’ political geographer Jim MacLaughlin tells us, ‘literally have to
    be built from the ground up.’ During the Irish Revolution, republicans
    engaged in the construction of a counter-state which included the sporadic
    application of alternative policing arrangements and a judiciary in the form
    of Dáil courts, as well as a representative assembly that was driven
    underground for much of the War of Independence. However, several recent and
    highly original works of scholarship underline once again that the
    revolutionary period was as much about destroying British state apparatus
    and perceived symbols of colonialism as it was about creating a new
    nation-state. This thread of destruction has been explored from a
    micro-level (the burning of a village) to a national level (the burning of
    roughly 300 country houses). Justin Dolan Stover's highly anticipated
    Enduring ruin examines environmental destruction between 1916 and 1923
    utilising a broad definition of environment that incorporates man-made
    structures, and their destruction, alongside rural landscapes. Stover's
    palpable rendering of the Easter Rising, for example, contends that
    ‘artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire, ensuing fires, looting, the
    collapse of asbestos-lined tenements, human and animal casualties, and
    odours indicative of unattended death grounded the rebellion's ruinous
    scope’ (p. 8). Enduring ruin innovatively elucidates the impact of this
    unique ‘sensory stamp’ on combatants and civilians while chronicling how
    propagandists utilised the imagery and language of the Great War to
    cultivate a sense of victimhood and elicit international sympathy (pp 12–13,
    112–18). Other chapters examine the impact of less overtly political
    environmental damage and the impact of reprisals by crown forces. Like
    Donlon and Dooley's monographs, Stover tactfully considers the interaction
    between landscape and people throughout, drawing attention to the important
    area of the revolutionary period's impact on the mental health of combatants
    and civilians (pp 74, 92–7). This work adds a highly original perspective by
    presenting the impact of tree felling, road trenching and incendiarism,
    contrasting the ‘romanticism’ of sawing trees ‘by hand under the cover of
    darkness’ with ‘the disillusionment of the mechanised evisceration of nature
    experienced along the Western Front’ (p. 61). Alongside using weather
    reports to illustrate how ‘extreme weather did not stymy guerrilla
    activity’, the author also employs a sample of 2,183 incidents of ‘landscape
    manipulation and ensuing damage to the built and natural environment’ which,
    like the burning of big houses, correlates to the more violent areas of the
    country (pp 70–73).

    , abstract:, The Dublin penny journal, the Irish penny journal, and the
    Irish penny magazine were weekly periodicals circulated in Ireland during
    the 1830s and 1840s. These penny publications intended to bring to a wider
    audience matters of Irish history, legend, topography, and discussions
    around Irish identity. As these publications were edited by antiquarians for
    much of their runs, a large amount of antiquarian research was published in
    their pages. This article explores how topics pertaining to medieval Irish
    literature are presented in these publications, given that they were aimed
    at a non-scholarly audience. These publications were linked to the promotion
    of a national idea and this article examines how the medieval texts selected
    for publication aided this aim in promoting a long literary past centred
    around the Irish language.

    In May 1922, James Craig described the Boundary Commission as the ‘root of
    all evil’ for Ulster unionists. Conversely, it ultimately bolstered the
    unionist cause, leaving the border unchanged and abandoning swathes of
    Northern nationalists who had assumed that large tracts of land would be
    transferred to the Free State. Offered to Sinn Féin plenipotentiaries during
    the 1921 Treaty negotiations, the Boundary Commission was viewed as a major
    concession by David Lloyd George, but the vague wording of the clause agreed
    to by the Irish delegation would prove disastrous. Delayed by the civil war
    and Unionist non-cooperation, the Boundary Commission finally convened in
    1924, hampered from the get-go by Sinn Féin’s naivety, the intransigence of
    Ulster unionists and the duplicity of successive British governments. It
    disbanded less than a year later without an inch gained for the twenty-six
    counties. After 1925, the nationalist community in the North had to accept
    that ‘whether they liked it or not, that they were citizens of Northern
    Ireland’, their trust in both British and Free State governments irrevocably
    damaged. One hundred years on, Cormac Moore illuminates the fascinating and
    infuriating story behind the Boundary Commission’s momentous failure.

    For over four decades the story of the extraordinary evil that occurred at
    the Kincora Boys’ Home in East Belfast in the 1970s and the shocking
    attempts by MI5 to cover it up have haunted our political and social terrain
    for decades. Award-winning former BBC journalist Chris Moore has been
    working on the story since it first emerged in 1980, and has uncovered a
    horrific catalogue of failed opportunities to put an end to the sadistic
    activities of the men who were running the home, in particular those of
    prominent Orangeman and MI5 source William McGrath.What has emerged over the
    course of Moore’s investigation, in which he has gained exclusive access to
    witnesses, secret documents and whistleblowers within the British
    intelligence services, is that not only were the boys in Kincora
    systematically sexually abused, but that some were forced into a countrywide
    paedophile ring, whose members included Lord Louis Mountbatten. Moore also
    exposes MI5’s attempts to cover up what actually happened and that the
    organisation knew as early as the 1970s that the boys in Kincora were being
    abused.Kincora is a shocking exposé of how the British state failed to
    protect some of its most vulnerable members.

  abstract: >-
    In the court of a late medieval Gaelic Irish lord, the steward (maor, pl.
    maoir) was a fiscal officer tasked with gathering tribute in the form of
    foodstuffs, rent, or tax. Maoir in this period are shadowy administrative
    figures, the archetype of which is a paid professional of relatively low
    social status. A geographically broad assessment seeks to show that the
    office of maor was fundamental to the tribute gathering apparatus that
    underpinned the administration of a Gaelic Irish lordship. A detailed
    examination of the O'Rodan (Uí Rodáin) lineage in Thomond sheds light on the
    functions of maoir in practice. From the mid-fourteenth century, the
    O'Rodans became enriched through the provision of stewardship services to
    the McNamara (Meic Conmara) lords of Clann Chuiléin. Their later entry into
    the service of the O'Brien (Uí Bhriain) earls of Thomond provides insight
    into the ability of maoir to shift allegiance.

    This article explores the Irish-American press’s engagement with the
    Franco-Prussian War, the unification of Germany and the Paris Commune. The
    leading papers — the Irish-American, the Irish Citizen, The Pilot and the
    Irish World — commented extensively on the Franco-Prussian War and its
    aftermath, and made use of widespread Irish-American sympathy for France in
    an attempt to influence the evolution of Irish-American ethnic immigrant
    identity after the American Civil War. The article assesses Irish-American
    editors’ opinions on the French and Prussian causes, and explores the
    parallels drawn with the Irish national cause. It then considers the
    Irish-American press's coverage of the American Republican party's
    pro-German stance after September 1870, which the editors assessed against
    the context of Reconstruction after 1865 and the attempts by Radical
    Republicans to achieve multi-racial citizenship in the United States.
    Finally, it explores Irish-American commentaries on the Paris Commune and
    the divisions between the editors that this international phenomenon
    fostered. It contributes to the study of the Irish-American experience of
    Reconstruction and the history of American engagement with international
    conflict after 1865.

    , abstract:, The ninth-century Longes mac nUislenn (LMU), the ‘Exile of the
    sons of Uisliu’, the oldest surviving version of the popular ‘Deirdriu
    story’, presents a stri-dent female protagonist who may at first glance
    appear to be proto-feminist. However, its political lessons ultimately
    reveal a conservative, patriarchal political order driven by male
    homosociality and undermined by female agency. The present article examines
    desire and its political consequences in LMU. Specifically, this article
    leverages theoretical tools from Louise Aranye Fradenburg’s work on desire
    and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s work on homosociality to analyze moments of
    decision-making in the text (where desire is most palpable) and map the
    constellation of desirous connections that revolve around the tale’s
    protagonist, Deirdriu. Doing so reveals how the tale predicates Conchobor’s
    kingship upon the successful conversion of desire into power, despite his
    unsavory behavior. Conversely, the inability of Deirdriu and the sons of
    Uisliu to do the same seals their tragic fate.

    , abstract:, This paper considers two cases of women able to transform into
    swans in the medieval Irish texts Aided Derbforgaill and Aislinge Óenguso.
    Using frameworks from trans studies and animal studies, it seeks to explore
    the differences in outcome for the two women, with Derbforgaill dying after
    rejection from humans and Cáer flying away with Óengus. The paper first
    considers how the women are similar, before turning to the differences
    between them, and, in particular, the disparity between their fates. This is
    explored through the idea of ‘species panic’, which suggests that figures
    depicted as being between species can destabilise the species status of
    those around them. I argue that this lens shows that Derbforgaill dies
    because her ability to transform between species leads her to become an
    outsider to a human community, while Cáer survives because she is always
    situated within a network of Otherworld beings like herself. This leads to a
    conclusion about one reason transformation stories are so prevalent within
    medieval Irish literature: because they provide a method of exploring social
    relationships in a legendary setting.

  abstract: >-
    Achmet Borumborad's arrival in Ireland in the 1760s, during which he claimed
    to be a Turk fleeing political persecution in Istanbul, quickly propelled
    him to prominence, making him one of the country's most distinguished
    figures. His published works and the establishment of a Turkish bath in
    Dublin, supported by the Irish parliament, solidified his reputation.
    However, Achmet's good fortune proved short-lived upon the discovery that he
    was, in fact, an Irishman. Consequently, he retreated from the public eye,
    and his life story has become one of the most widely known tales of
    corruption that contributed to the dissolution of the Irish parliament. This
    paper explores the extraordinary account of Achmet through previously unused
    documents, offering not only fascinating insights into social life in
    eighteenth-century Ireland but also intriguing revelations regarding
    perceptions of the Ottoman Empire and ‘Turkish fashion’ during this era.
