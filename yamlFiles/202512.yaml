  abstract: >-
    Between 1883 and 1897, the British Department of Science and Art’s lace
    expert Alan S. Cole (1846–1934) made eleven official visits to Ireland to
    lecture, inspect lacemaking and design centers, and report on his findings.
    His interventions contributed to a period of growth and development in the
    industry, which had been introduced as a philanthropic venture in the
    mid-nineteenth century. However, Cole’s widely circulated writings on lace
    design and making produced between 1884 and 1897 also reveal ambivalence and
    inconsistency, particularly in relation to questions of mechanization in the
    lace industry, the agency of lacemakers, the relationship between good
    design and the demands of the market, and the home as a locus for lace
    production. This essay outlines Cole’s involvement in the Irish lace
    industry, placing his reports in the context of contemporary design
    education strategies and texts on lacemaking, and considering how he frames
    the industry—in particular, lacemakers and the spaces of lacemaking—in ways
    that negotiate the often conflicting needs of the market, design education
    bodies, and philanthropists, and intersect with colonial, gender, and
    class-based imperatives to mold, monitor, and represent Irish women and
    their homes.

  abstract: >-
    The Stained and Bloodied Cloths of Ireland presents a textiles and material
    culture view of Irish shame, oppression, morality and repression. Ireland –
    North and South – has sustained significant change in the last 100 years,
    accelerating at the end of the 20th century with the legalization of
    contraception, divorce, gay marriage, the end of the ‘Troubles’, and freedom
    to choose abortion and reproductive autonomy. In parallel to this, troubling
    instances of abuse, repression and cruelty have come to light through a
    series of scandals. These included the exploitation of unmarried mothers as
    unpaid labour in laundries, the deaths of women and babies in mishandled
    miscarriages, the unhealthy entanglement of Church and State, and the
    intolerance shown to 'visible Irish and immigrant minorities' in the
    so-called ‘land of a thousand welcomes’. This collection of specially
    commissioned essays tells the stories of cloth, clothing, textiles and
    materials that have been actually or symbolically stained by blood or other
    bodily fluids in Ireland’s last 100 years. By focusing on the role of these
    materials in the events and experiences of shame, oppression, morality and
    repression, the book ‘lances the boil’ of Irish social history, celebrating
    the movement of the island of Ireland into post-Church, post-conflict,
    post-nostalgia modernity that, while a painful transition, is a vital part
    of coming to terms with its past and looking to its future.

  abstract: >-
    This article examines the structure and role of the Ulster Special
    Constabulary (USC) in rural Ulster in 1922. It is argued the actions of the
    USC during this period have not received sufficient academic or public
    attention. The origins and organisational structure of the Specials are
    considered and it is claimed that the force’s decentralised make-up made it
    almost impossible to control. In terms of personnel, access to newly
    released archives gives unique insight into the force. Traditional
    assumptions about the connection between the pre-war Ulster Volunteer Force
    and the USC are questioned. Furthermore, it is found that few ‘B’ Specials
    had prior service with the British army. Overall, it is concluded that the
    Specials were an almost exclusively Protestant force made up of
    inexperienced and at times ill-disciplined recruits, most of whom were
    ill-suited to any policing role. Furthermore, it is argued that the Specials
    played a significant role in shaping post-partition identities in Northern
    Ireland.
