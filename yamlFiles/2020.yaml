    This volume examines eighteenth-century Irish literature, highlighting the
    diversity of texts, authors and approaches that characterises contemporary
    studies of the period. Chapters consider the contexts of history, politics,
    language, philosophy, gender, sexuality, and the environment while situating
    Irish literature in relation to Ireland, Britain, Europe and beyond.
    Well-known authors (Jonathan Swift, Edmund Burke and Oliver Goldsmith) are
    read alongside less familiar writers (including Mary Barber, William
    Chaigneau, Frances Sheridan, and Samuel Whyte) and popular and ephemeral
    literatures take their place with formerly canonical texts. It demonstrates
    the exciting vitality and richness of eighteenth-century Irish literature -
    written and performed - as well as its complex intersections with different
    communities and traditions. This book will be a key resource to scholars and
    students of Irish eighteenth-century studies as well as readers generally
    interested in questions of Anglophone and Irish-language culture,
    representations of gender and sexuality, and national and trans-national
    identities.
