    This companion contains new and innovative writing on Irish art and its
    history, from c. 1800 to the present day.

    This book critically engages with Irish art in a period linked to key events
    in Irish history, beginning with the Acts of Union between Britain and
    Ireland (1800–01)) and the significant social and cultural changes that
    resulted. The book also provides a precedent for a focus on the significance
    of art in relation to other subsequent key historical events such as the
    early twentieth‑century struggles for independence or the role of political
    conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s onwards and its aftermath.
    Key themes covered include tradition and innovation; upheavals of history;
    place, location, and artistic formations; Irish art and the wider world; and
    embodiment and identity. The book expands the critical discourse around
    Irish art over this period, both within Ireland and beyond, and encourages
    the potential for future scholarship in fields and periods not covered.

    This book will be of interest to scholars and students working in art
    history, Irish studies, and colonial studies.

    Damian Shiels's Green and Blue explores Irish American service in the United
    States military by analyzing the written correspondence of ordinary
    rank-and-file soldiers drawn from across the Union's armed forces. Using a
    vast and largely untapped collection of letters penned by Irish American
    combatants to their families during the war, Shiels explains how these
    enlisted men navigated their duties from multiple perspectives, including
    how they adapted to and experienced military life, how they engaged with
    their faith, and how they interacted with the home front. Green and Blue
    offers the most detailed and intimate picture yet of Irish Americans'
    service in the United States military during the Civil War.

  abstract: "Celebrated in song by Christy Moore and affectionately recalled in many memoirs, Robert \"Bob\" Hilliard, the author's grandfather, is one of Ireland's best-known International Brigadistas. His short life blazed with a rare intensity; his death in Spain left a dark shadow hanging over his family. This book unravels Hilliard’s enigmas to bring us an absorbing character and a fresh understanding of the times that shaped him.\_Hilliard was radicalised at school by the Irish revolution. Variously a journalist, an Olympic boxer for Ireland and a Church of Ireland priest, he became a communist and anti-fascist in London, fought with the International Brigades in\_the Spanish Civil War and died of wounds sustained at the Battle of Jarama. Eloquent and colourful, he inspires puzzlement as well as admiration. Why was his life so full of contradictions? One question haunted the author's mother: how could he leave his children? Lin Rose Clark sets out to find answers.\_Through meticulous research and a deeply personal exploration of her family's past, she brings together an engrossing picture of the man and a tale of flawed romance, passionate commitment and war, portraying Hilliard as part of a turbulent history that still reverberates today."

    A glimpse at the long and winding history of Irishwomen United reminds us
    how far we've come.  The vast accomplishments of modern Irish feminism would
    look very different without the courageous, yet often overlooked, efforts of
    Irishwomen United (IWU) activists in the years following the Contraceptive
    Train of 1971. This phenomenal collection of nineteen essays offers
    firsthand, historical accounts of on-the-ground activities during this
    period, shining a light of neglected truth on the history of how Ireland was
    changed. In this book, writer and IWU member Evelyn Conlon, with the
    academic and editorial support of Rebecca Pelan, ensures the impact of the
    organization will no longer be forgotten.  The collective memories of these
    women describe everything from pickets to sit-ins, self-questioning to
    dancing, the development of feminist ideas, and publishing despite the
    restrictive laws and attitudes surrounding them. Through relentless,
    difficult discussions, publications, marches, and allyship with the global
    Feminist and Civil Rights Movement, the ideas of IWU were transformed into
    action for the sake of reproductive rights, sexuality, representation, and
    rape crisis work.  A foreword from former Irish President Mary McAleese
    contextualizes the collective labor of IWU within a not-so-distant past in
    Ireland. This book also features an archive of original art, flyers,
    photographs, and memorabilia of the movement, many appearing for the first
    time in print.  Irishwomen United and their allies set the precedent for
    change for the next generation. The stories of these women campaigners are
    not only representative of past movements but also a call to action for
    future social justice activists in the fight for liberation and equality for
    all.

    From the late fourteenth century onwards, Scottish writers began to exhibit
    a conceptual dichotomy within the surviving sources, by which the kingdom’s
    inhabitants were divided along linguistic and geographical lines between the
    Gaelic-speaking Highlands and Islands and the Scots-speaking Lowlands.
    According to this understanding of Scotland’s development, influenced by the
    barbaric characterisations of Scots offered by earlier continental and
    English chroniclers, both regions and their inhabitants began to function as
    distinct, semi-autonomous societies within one polity, with Gaelic Scots
    being framed as aggressive, unruly and insular compared to the more
    industrious and peaceable Lowlanders.¹ While significant differences in

    early as the mid-1540s. An Calbhach had risen against his father in 1548,
    only to suffer a crushing defeat.¹ An Calbhach, it seems, did not possess
    the military clout needed to unseat his father and Maghnus remained

    At the dawn of the sixteenth century, the idea of a unitary British state,
    composite or otherwise, was a distant dream. At least a third of the
    archipelago comprising the Irish and British Isles remained under the
    control of powerful autonomous Gaelic-speaking lineages. The western section
    of these islands was essentially a politically fragmented world. In Ireland,
    the effective reach of the English crown was largely confined to the region
    known as the Dublin Pale, and the land and seascapes from the Blaskets to
    Malin Head were ruled by dozens of competing aristocratic entities. Munster

    This book offers important new insights into the history and culture of the
    Gaelic-speaking world from the mid-fifteenth century through to the reign of
    James VI and I. Throughout this period, the reach of the English and
    Scottish crowns within these western regions was limited. The initiative lay
    with local communities and royal power was contingent upon negotiating with
    well-established and largely autonomous aristocratic lineages. Moreover,
    events within this western world could exert a powerful, often
    unpredictable, influence upon the affairs of the wider archipelago. Using a
    series of case studies, this collection examines the evolving relationship
    between Ireland and Scotland in rich detail. It demonstrates how this world
    interacted with the encroaching English and Scottish states and underlines
    the importance of paying closer attention to this neglected area of Irish
    and British history.  -- .

    This article demonstrates that, notwithstanding Ireland's 1949 Commonwealth
    secession, it (re)established an informal external association with this
    grouping's principal concrete concerns, which remained quite extensive, that
    lasted throughout the 1950s. By law or practice, 1950s Ireland lifted alien
    restrictions on most Commonwealth citizens and its citizens received
    preferential treatment in most Commonwealth countries. It participated in
    the Commonwealth tariff ‘system' by both giving and receiving preferences
    based on ‘Commonwealth' status and by maintaining long-standing trade
    agreements with the UK, Canada and South Africa. As with all the
    Commonwealth bar Canada, it remained within the Sterling Area which greatly
    bolstered economic links. Ireland also participated in several lower-level
    Commonwealth fora and its ‘special position' was said to strikingly
    illustrate the Commonwealth's capacity to adjust. However, it took no part
    in high-level political consultation and, even in functional areas (with the
    singular exception of agricultural research), lacked privileges to exercise
    leadership or even clear rights. These limitations bolstered interest in
    rejoining especially in the late 1950s. However, allied to a background a
    recognition that the Commonwealth was becoming less central to concrete
    links including in the crucial UK context, this was rendered politically
    impossible by the unresolved issue of Partition.

    Especially as regards Commonwealth restrictions, Ireland's immigration
    policy has been seen as (surreptitiously) dependent on UK policy. Although
    the Common Travel Area imposed serious limits, Irish discretion was in fact
    significant and restrictive. In 1948–9 the United Kingdom secured Ireland's
    public commitment to extend reciprocal citizenship rights to all the
    Commonwealth, notwithstanding its secession, but Ireland avoided this
    vis-à-vis the ‘new’ Commonwealth and left its aliens exemption law
    deliberately opaque. Whilst broadly mirroring the UK Commonwealth Immigrants
    Act 1962, Ireland retained apartheid South Africa as partially privileged
    and only comprehensively exempted British citizens born within the United
    Kingdom. From 1973, the United Kingdom largely abandoned any privileged
    treatment but, in entirely removing this in 1975 and selectively imposing
    visas from 1976, Ireland went beyond even this. These divergences reflected
    that, compared to the United Kingdom, it had left an increasingly diverse
    Commonwealth in 1949 and had a stronger homogenous nationalism.

    The poem ‘Éistibh a lucht an tigh-se’ (hereafter ‘Éistibh’) is contained in
    the <em>Book of the Dean of Lismore</em> (hereafter BDL), a
    sixteenth-century anthology whose folios include the earliest surviving
    collection of Gaelic verse in Scotland. From internal evidence, it seems the

    patronage and participation of the local nobility and their networks,
    foremost of whom were the Caimbeulaich of Argyll and Glenorchy.² However,

    A fascinating, well-illustrated and internationally researched biography of
    Richard Henry Brunton, a talented civil engineer in the nineteenth century
    and a proud representative of his profession in a rapidly changing world.
    Brunton was born in Muchalls, Aberdeenshire and initially worked on railway
    line development. He then came to prominence as Chief Engineer to the
    Japanese Government when the country was forced to ”open up”. As well as
    eventually supervising the building of 26 Western-style tower lighthouses
    along with various other navigational initiatives, he additionally
    established a groundbreaking staff training and technical complex for this
    move. Furthermore, he also took a lead in town planning of the chief trading
    settlement of Yokohama, and in other matters too. Returning to the United
    Kingdom, Brunton eventually became manager of a large petrochemical plant in
    the central ‘belt’ of Scotland, getting involved as well with working man’s’
    broader education and then, moving back south, took over an architectural
    ornaments business in London. The company won prizes and worked at home and
    around the globe. Unfortunately, although extensive, the work was
    over-stressful and he over-dipped into its income to the extent he was
    declared personally bankrupt. However, one of his theatrical clients, based
    in Ireland, approached him to become their architect and there he created
    three gems of theatre design, two of which, in the cities of Dublin and
    Cork, still successfully function.

    Good Trouble will show the strong connection between the Black Civil Rights
    Movement in the United States and the Catholic Civil Rights Movement in
    Northern Ireland - specifically the influence of the Montgomery to Selma
    march on the 1969 Belfast to Derry march through oral history, based on
    numerous interviews of events leading up to both marches and afterwards.
    This is close to the author's heart as both of his parents marched to
    integrate lunch counters and movie theatres in Salisbury, North Carolina, in
    1963 as college students. His mother was at the 1963 March to Washington
    where Martin Luther King gave his 'I Have a Dream' speech. Award winning
    author Julieann Campbell (On Bloody Sunday) wrote the introduction for Good
    Trouble, looking back at her times growing up in Derry, in the heart of the
    Catholic Civil Rights Movement. Jones travelled to Dublin, Belfast and Derry
    to conduct interviews for the book. In all, he did fifteen interviews with
    people who were involved in the movement in Northern Ireland (including
    Billy McVeigh - featured in the BAFTA winning documentary, Once Upon A Time
    In Northern Ireland) and in the United States (including Richard Smiley and
    Dr. Sheyann Webb-Christburg - both were at Bloody Sunday in Alabama and on
    the Selma to Montgomery march among others). Jones was also able to talk
    with Eamonn McCann (he took part in the Belfast to Derry march in 1969; he
    was the John Lewis of Northern Ireland). Unlike most books on Northern
    Ireland, this goes into detail about the connection and the influence
    between the two movements. Also, most focus on Bloody Sunday and not the
    pivotal incidents at Burntollet Bridge and the Battle of the Bogside.
    Building off of unprecedented access and interviews with participants in
    both movements, Jones crafts a gripping and moving account of these pivotal
    years for both countries.

    The early 17th Century was a time of great turbulence in our society, but
    also of continuity. Most importantly to us, it was a time of diligent record
    keeping which we can access today to understand better where we have come
    from. From the licence to distil whiskey in 1608 to the statistics which
    even then oiled the wheels of government, we can recognise our modern world
    in the records of 400 years ago.Fundamental to 'place' is (or was) the
    townland - confusing to outsiders (and now many of us locals) this unit of
    land has been in use for centuries, from the 12th-century land grants of
    mediaeval monasteries to the line on your domestic rates bill today. Until
    the mid-20th century (and much later in some localities), rural addresses
    were given exclusively by townland and the road names and numbers we use
    today were meaningless to country dwellers. Small enough to be personal in
    scale but significant enough for government use, townlands stood the test of
    time until the processing power of computers and our increasingly mobile and
    urbanised society brought in postcodes and an increasing number of
    administrative divisions adrift from our history.This publication maps all
    16,000 townlands in the 9 counties of Ulster and the administrative units of
    church and state into which they have been organised. In an attractive and
    easily understood layout, these units are shown in the context of land
    ownership in the 17th century, a pattern clearly recognisable until a
    century ago when the Land Purchase Acts broke up the estates and facilitated
    tenant farmers buying their own land. By using the maps and index, family
    and local historians can easily grasp the essentials of our ancestors' lives
    - where they worked, paid their rent, went to church and market, etc.This is
    an essential reference guide for both newcomer and serious researcher,
    showing exact locations and where to look for related records. This material
    has never been collated for the entire province before.

    For most of the sixteenth century, west Bréifne did not feature in the
    considerations of the Tudor regime for its governance of Ireland. It was
    only in the last quarter that ongoing contact with the Uí Ruairc [O’Rourke]
    was maintained by Tudor officials as they sought to extend crown authority
    into the north-west. This relationship became fractious because of the
    independent stance of Brian na Múrtha [‘of the Ramparts’] Ó Ruairc and his
    son, Brian Óg na Samhthach [‘of the Axe-handle’]. Faced with the demands of
    an expanding crown administration on the one hand and the resurgent power of

    The ' long seventeenth century' was a time of enormous religious and
    political change in Ireland, but there has never been a satisfactory study
    of the Church of Ireland throughout this turbulent period. This book fills
    the gap, drawing on rich research undertaken in recent years by a number of
    eminent scholars. It considers the way in which the church changed over
    time, focusing on crucial ' hinge' events such as the mid-century rebellion
    and Cromwellian occupation, and the existential threat posed to the church
    in the Jacobite period. It looks at many different facets of the Church of
    Ireland in the period, including education, music, and the acquisition and
    use of silver; it covers not only important bishops but also ordinary parish
    clergy, and reveals the lives of clergy and laity in the more distant
    provinces as well as metropolitan Dublin. Together, the essays present a
    composite picture of a church in a time of change.

    This article explores the little-known response of the Irish Save the
    Children Fund to famine in Soviet Russia and Ukraine from 1921, as well as
    to hunger in the west of Ireland in 1924–5. Drawing on wide-ranging sources
    from the Cadbury Research Library, the Women’s Library at LSE and elsewhere,
    it examines the translation of humanitarian relief into different local,
    national and transnational contexts. The Volga famine was a seismic moment
    in inter-war humanitarianism and the initial focus of the newly formed Irish
    Save the Children Fund, itself formed in the context of war and civil war.
    Humanitarianism in the new Irish Free State had distinctive gendered, class
    and religious dynamics, as well as connections to Britain and the Irish
    diaspora. This article argues that tracing relatively small and largely
    unexamined organisations like the Irish Save the Children Fund offers new
    angles into the relationship between humanitarianism, nationhood and social
    change.

    In their 1988 critical edition of William Baldwin’s comic prose satire
    Beware the Cat (composed 1553; printed 1561), William Ringler and Michael
    Flachmann assert that Baldwin (1526/7–1563) derived two anecdotes included
    in the work directly from Topographia Hibernica, a twelfth-century survey of
    Ireland composed by the well-travelled churchman and historian Gerald of
    Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis).1 The anecdotes are related during a fireside
    discussion that the work’s principal character, Gregory Streamer, recalls
    having with various men at the Aldersgate residence of the prominent London
    printer John Day (d. 1584).2 Streamer, who was lodging with Day, remarks to
    those around him on the great noise he heard cats making atop the London
    wall on the previous night. Streamer’s remark leads the company into a
    discussion of whether or not animals have rational understanding.3 One of
    those present recalls being told of a cat that spoke in English to a man in
    Staffordshire. Another member of the group, named Thomas, then relates a
    tale he had heard in Ireland of a mysterious cat that asked two men for food
    in Gaelic and proceeded thereafter to eat in their entirety a sheep and a
    cow.

    How the South African War transformed nationalist politics across Ireland’s
    global diasporaIn 1899, the British Empire embarked on a deeply
    controversial war against two small Boer Republics in South Africa. To many
    Irish nationalists, the Boers were fellow victims of British mistreatment.
    Defeat for the Boers, they worried, would mean defeat for the principle that
    small, white nations like Ireland were entitled to govern themselves.
    Widespread outrage sparked a dramatic resurgence in Irish nationalism after
    a decade of disunity and decline.The shape and strength of this revival
    varied throughout Ireland’s vast global diaspora. Ireland’s Opportunity
    traces the impact of “Boer fever” across Ireland and the diaspora networks
    that connected Irish communities in the United States, Canada, Australia,
    and New Zealand.Home Rulers reunited to oppose the war, even as those in
    Britain’s colonies asserted their loyalty to the empire and its racist
    underpinnings. Fenian revolutionaries, meanwhile, saw “England’s difficulty”
    in South Africa as “Ireland’s opportunity” to strike for independence.
    Explosive conspiracies hatched in Ireland and the United States failed to
    kindle the desired revolution. But the lessons and legacies of the South
    African War years would shape their fateful response when “England’s
    difficulty” returned after 1914.Blending global perspectives with intimate
    portraits of individuals whose lives were forever changed by the war, Shane
    Lynn reveals how Irish nationalism was a global phenomenon with a tangled
    and paradoxical relationship to empire.

    This volume comprises the first eight lectures (2017-2024) presented in
    memory of Jennifer O'Reilly, a renowned expert in early medieval Insular
    culture. The Memorial Lecture Series was established in 2017 by the School
    of History, University College Cork, where Dr O'Reilly spent most of her
    career. Each year a distinguished scholar is invited to speak on either the
    writings of Bede (c. 673-735) or medieval iconography, two subjects that Dr
    O'Reilly explored in her research and teaching. The studies in this volume,
    which are varied in subject matter and approach, indicating the breadth and
    depth of the honorand's scholarship, offer ground-breaking insights into
    early medieval Insular culture. The contents illuminate our understanding of
    relations between the islands of Britain and Ireland during the Age of Bede.
    Analyses of the writings of Bede, situate his work in the context of his
    patristic inheritance and his monastic community of Wearmouth and Jarrow,
    thereby advancing our knowledge of that influential monastery. New
    approaches to medieval art and iconography highlight the importance of
    specific imagery in Insular culture and re-examine one of the most iconic
    examples of Insular art, the high cross. This book will be of value to
    anyone interested in early medieval Ireland and Britain, especially those
    who wish to learn more about cross-cultural connections between these
    islands, and the interpretation of Scripture in Insular culture.

    Did the Gaels of late medieval Scotland and Ireland conceptualise themselves
    as a distinctive polity? Steven Ellis argued in 1999 that modern historians
    have imposed Scotland and Ireland retrospectively and anachronistically upon
    what was, in fact, a unitary late-medieval Gaelic world, or ‘Greater
    Gaeldom’.¹ A companion article to this paper investigates this thesis with
    regard to identity and culture.² The focus here is political, commencing
    with a brief discussion of Scottish realpolitik before turning to Gaelic
    political thought. It builds upon the foundational studies by Mícheál Ó
    Mainnín, Wilson McLeod and Pía Coira, drawing like them upon Gaelic poetry,

    Medieval and early modern Irish parliaments and towns have historically been
    seen as quintessentially English institutions which existed almost
    exclusively for an Anglophone colonial community, although Brendan Bradshaw
    warned against this reading:¹  One of the accepted truisms of
    sixteenth-century Irish historiography concerns the attitude of the
    Anglo-Irish of the Pale and of the towns towards the Gaelic Irish [which was
    characterised as being] set in a mould of colonial contempt and hostility …

    The relative success of the Danish and failure of the Irish dairy industries
    before the First World War is often contrasted. The traditional narrative
    assumes that the Irish failed because they were unsuccessful at adopting
    cooperative ownership, and that Irish cooperatives were not as efficient as
    their Danish counterparts, despite having been explicitly modelled on them.
    This is, however, untested at the ‘firm’ level. We rectify this through the
    analysis of a large microlevel database of creameries in both countries over
    the period 1898–1903. Using Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), a standard
    methodology in modern productivity studies, we find that Irish creameries
    were in fact slightly more efficient on average than their Danish
    counterparts, although with a larger variance. This nuances the idea that
    the Irish were unable to establish cooperatives successfully, although some
    creameries were certainly laggards, and the reputational cost of this might
    have impacted the industry.

  abstract: >-
    The turbulent revolutionary period in modern Irish history from 1912 to 1923
    had a profound impact on the political, economic and social make-up of
    Laois. The issue of land that had dominated the landscape of Laois from the
    late nineteenth century onwards, continued to do so during the Irish
    revolutionary years, often intertwined with the major political developments
    of the era. Cormac Moore’ s book explores how seismic national events from
    the Third Home Rule Crisis, through to the First World War, the 1916 Easter
    Rising, the War of Independence and the Civil War affected Laois. Moore’ s
    book provides a comprehensive extensively researched account of how the
    Irish Revolution impacted on all sections of Laois society at the time, with
    its effects reverberating for years after.

  abstract: >-
    Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of authors, this book relays the
    untold story of postwar migration between Ireland and Australia. Spanning
    the period 1945–2024, it explores the experiences of migrants from the
    Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and provides insights into the
    multiple reasons these migrants came to Australia, factors which prompted
    permanency or return, and the extent of continuity and change between recent
    arrivals and their historical predecessors.Contemporary flows are examined
    through the lens of social, economic, policy, and technological changes
    occurring at the time in Ireland, Australia, and globally. Decades of
    economic boom and bust in Ireland, including the growth and demise of the
    Celtic Tiger, the impact of government investment in education in the
    Republic, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, occurred alongside marked
    changes in Australia’s immigration policy. During this time, an increased
    affordability of international travel and communication brought new dynamics
    to the tyranny of distance that characterised historical flows. How
    contemporary migrants from Ireland navigated these changes in terms of
    identity and belonging, homesickness, and transnationalism are the key
    themes which are explored. The role of Ireland’s Government in relation to
    its migrant community in Australia and the impact of COVID-19 are also
    considered.This book not only fills a gap in Ireland’s diaspora research but
    also contributes to migration studies more broadly, particularly the
    experiences of invisible immigrants.

  abstract: >-
    Since 2020, Irish people have donated over $2.5 million to a relief fund
    supporting residents of the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northeastern
    Arizona. Many donors believed their contributions helped `repay a debt' owed
    by the Irish to Native Americans—specifically, the Choctaw Nation, which
    sent aid to Ireland during the 1847 Famine. This article examines how Irish
    people understand their historical links to settler colonialism and how
    valid or common it is for them to express solidarity with other colonized
    peoples, particularly Indigenous groups. Focusing on the relationship
    between the Irish and Native Americans, especially the Choctaw Nation of
    Oklahoma since the 1990s, the article explores this expression of
    solidarity. It considers the historical rationale offered by Irish donors to
    the Navajo and Hopi between 2020 and 2024 via GoFundMe, framing it as
    repayment for the Choctaw's 1847 gift. Using Charles Mills' concept of white
    ignorance, the article critiques how these acts of solidarity can obscure
    Ireland's own role in settler colonialism—from treaty negotiations that
    displaced Indigenous peoples to participation in land dispossession. By
    selectively remembering shared suffering while ignoring complicity in
    colonialism, Irish narratives reveal a more complex and sometimes
    problematic form of solidarity.

    In November 2023, the Dublin riots shocked Ireland and the wider world. They
    were sparked by a knife attack by an immigrant on three children.
    Inflammatory online rumours spread in minutes. Part of the north inner city
    were wrecked, cars and buses torched, and protestors wreaked havoc on the
    streets for hours.Until very recently, Ireland had prided itself on having
    escaped the wave of far-right, xenophobic populism now rampant throughout
    Europe. That complacency has been rudely challenged.In Burn Them Out!,
    Pádraig Óg Ó Ruairc explores the long history that has led to this pivotal
    moment. He uncovers the pervasive anti-Semitism of the Irish political elite
    in the 1920s and 30s, the energetic efforts of Mosley and other British
    fascists to extend their movement to the North of Ireland, the IRA's
    alliance with Nazi Germany in the 40s and the many ultra-Catholic,
    anti-communist Irish movements that were millimetres away from fascism. He
    tells the story of exotic entities like the Fascio di Dublino, the Dublin
    branch of Mussolini's Fascist Party, and the Irish wing of Miss Rotha
    Lintorn-Orman's 'British Fascisti'. The openly-fascist Irish movement known
    as the Blueshirts, an offshoot and ally of the early Fine Gael, is looked at
    with fresh eyes, and its supporters' statements about Jews now make for
    hair-raising reading. Many of its proponents went on to become pillars of
    the Irish political and cultural establishment. And the Catholic and
    nationalist Ailtirí na hAiséirghe (Architects of the Resurrection), a
    post-war sect, was in many ways a precursor of today's Irish far right.This
    is an essential book about an aspect of Irish history all too often swept
    under the carpet.

    The creation of Lives for local saints in the sixteenth century provided a
    method of preserving their traditions and an opportunity for their authors
    to manipulate their characters to benefit political interests within their

    presenting the saint as laying claim to church land and holy features of the

    In the course of compiling my electronic catalogue of extant bardic poetry,
    which was focussed originally on the period 1200–1631,¹ I identified
    nineteen poems (listed in the appendix to this paper) as associated with
    Scottish patrons or authors but not forming part of that great anthology of
    medieval and early sixteenth-century Scottish poetry known as the Book of
    the Dean of Lismore.² Subsequently, Professor Wilson McLeod very kindly drew
    my attention to two further examples listed below as nos 20 and 21 but not
    appearing on the web version of the electronic catalogue. The list comprises
    mostly well-known texts,

    Women’s cultural and political engagement with oral tales and traditions in
    European peripheries With Seekers of Wonder, Elena Sottilotta offers the
    first comparative study of women’s manifold roles in the collection of
    Italian and Irish folklore and fairy tales between 1870 and 1920. Sottilotta
    views the often-overlooked work of these women from an interdisciplinary
    perspective, considering both the politics and poetics of seeking wonder. In
    so doing, she centers women’s influence on the preservation and
    dissemination of oral traditions, bringing work that was once relegated to
    the margins into dialogue with work long regarded as canonical.After mapping
    sidelined, marginalized, and forgotten women folklorists, Sottilotta narrows
    the focus onto four writers and collectors who were inspired by Italian and
    Irish insular contexts: Laura Gonzenbach, who collected Sicilian wonder
    tales; Grazia Deledda, who wrote Sardinian ethnographic sketches, legends,
    and fairy tales; Jane Wilde, who published anthologies of Irish folklore;
    and Augusta Gregory, who collected traditional narratives in the west of
    Ireland. Situated within an ongoing process of rediscovery of lesser-known
    collectors, tellers, and tales in the European tradition, Sottilotta
    relocates these figures within a broader transcultural framework.Throughout,
    Sottilotta emphasizes the role of women as crucial intermediaries between
    different cultural groups―in particular, between the world of the “folk” and
    the world of scholarly folklore studies. Unearthing rare archival material
    and reading these writings from the perspective of gender, Sottilotta sheds
    light on the identity dynamics that animated the cultural phenomenon of
    collecting folk and fairy tales in this era.

    ‘I was in the Army over thirty years and Derry was the most resentful place
    I ever served, even the dogs hated us.’ When civil rights protests in the
    1960s gave way to armed struggle, the Provisional IRA in Derry – both city
    and county – led the fight against the British security forces. In the city
    Martin McGuinness – a young butcher’s assistant from the Bogside – quickly
    rose through the ranks, launching a bombing campaign that reduced the city
    centre to rubble. In tandem, the IRA’s active service units fought the
    British Army in the streets and alleys of the Bogside, Creggan, Shantallow
    and the Waterside. Out in the townlands, a new generation from the county’s
    traditional republican families waged an equally ruthless war against their
    neighbours in the RUC and UDR. The Derry Brigade’s success would help propel
    McGuinness to the very top of the IRA’s Army Council. By the early 1980s the
    Derry Brigade appeared untouchable. However, in reality, Special Branch and
    British Intelligence had infiltrated it from top to bottom and almost
    destroyed the brigade. By the mid-1990s its war was all but over, its ranks
    decimated by death and incarceration. This is the story of that war told by
    those from all sides who survived it.

    The Irish frame drum that we know as 'bodhrán' first entered modern-day
    Irish consciousness in 1959 with John B. Keane's use of a tambourine in his
    play Sive at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. From 1960 onwards, it gained
    tremendous visibility in the traditional music revival through Seán Ó
    Riada's Radio Éireann ensemble Ceoltóirí Chualann, then by the Chieftains,
    and, later, by the Bothy Band, Planxty, Christy Moore and De Dannan. By the
    end of the century, tens of thousands of bodhráns had been made and
    dispersed worldwide, and the instrument was a staple in traditional music
    promoted by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann. Today the drum holds a remarkable
    symbolic presence not only in Irish music, but also in tourism and in sport,
    to the extent that it rivals the harp as a national emblem. To date there
    has been no coherent picture of how the bodhrán could appear so suddenly in
    the twentieth century. Its name is certainly old - a word once used for a
    device which was created millennia ago as an agricultural tool, a container
    and tray. But as a percussion form with the sophistication that we know it
    today its traceable history is short, beginning sporadically only in the
    earlier 1800s, and mostly happening since c.1960, shaped by ingenious
    stylists, most of whom are indeed still performing among us. Beating Time
    explores this history for the first time. It radically acknowledges not only
    the influence of the music trade and British military bands, but that of the
    touring ensembles that were the roots of today's popular music - the
    American 'blackface' minstrels. The study also examines the use of
    tambourines on the 'Wren', and the morphing of this into accompaniment and
    solo playing in today's 'listening' traditional music. Perhaps most
    remarkable is the unspoken re-branding of the tambourine as 'bodhrán', and
    its kindling, liberation and validation of the percussion impulse in
    traditional music. Rather than mythicising the bodhrán as the oldest Irish
    music instrument, this book points to the idea that it should perhaps be
    celebrated for being the newest. Its rapid emergence and transformation is
    as remarkable and astonishing an ascent in universal popularity and
    international acceptance as has been the worldwide rise of the guitar in all
    music.
