    Since the signing of the 1998 peace agreement, which marked the end of the
    violent conflict, Northern Ireland has remained largely stable. Once a
    hotbed of violence, Belfast has gone on to enjoy the benefits of peace,
    including urban regeneration, the emergence of an affluent middle class,
    economic development, increased job opportunities, and vibrant tourism. Yet
    in the same city, little has improved for those living in the most
    economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. These working-class areas bore the
    brunt of the conflict and continue to be excluded from the dividends of
    peace. The physical walls that separate communities reinforce memories of
    past hostilities and contribute to a sense of hopelessness about the future.
    Using Belfast as a case study, this article examines the spatial context of
    violence during the conflict and its role in shaping collective memory. It
    argues that post-conflict societies must address the persistent challenge of
    spatial inequality to fulfill the promises of peace.

    From the beginning of 1969, panicked Irish diplomats based across the United
    States beseeched Iveagh House, the headquarters for the Irish Department of
    Foreign Affairs, to release an updated policy on raising Northern Ireland as
    an issue at the United Nations Security Council. These requests resulted
    from an influx of pressure from Irish Americans who were becoming
    increasingly concerned about the unfolding situation in Northern Ireland.
    Following the heavily publicised scenes from Derry on 5 October 1968, which
    showed police officers beating and dragging civil rights protestors on the
    city’s streets, Irish American interest in the Northern Irish civil rights
    movement proliferated across the country and across different sections of
    the diasporic community. While historians have found that the Irish
    government neglected to effectively monitor the emerging civil rights
    movement in Northern Ireland, Irish diplomats in the US paid careful
    attention to how Irish Americans felt about and reacted to the nascent
    movement in Northern Ireland from early on. Using government documents from
    the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, this article examines the reaction
    from the Irish embassy and consulates to Irish American lobbying, analysing
    how factors such as class, political ideology and attitudes towards national
    identity differentiated these responses. This article argues that fissures
    in the relationship between the state and sections of its diaspora in the
    US, which stemmed from divisions over the Irish Civil War, contributed to
    the heightened sensitivity towards Irish American attitudes and actions as
    tensions began to rise in Northern Ireland.

    This essay puts Irish revolutionary James Connolly into conversation with
    the much more well-known figure of Frantz Fanon. Both thinker-combatants
    were deeply situated in their own contexts, giving rise to political theory
    and action as expressions of the politics of colonized peoples. While David
    Lloyd has suggested that the similarities between these and other “national
    Marxists” are tendential, there do exist numerous positive similarities in
    their work. Both Connolly and Fanon were anticolonial theorists committed to
    a project of disalienation beyond mere expropriation of the means of
    production but encompassing the realm of the symbolic. Both were ardent
    internationalists, presenting a theory of the relationship of the universal
    to the particular which saw national liberation as an intrinsic part of the
    socialist struggle – and vice versa. And both stressed revolutionary
    transformation as a necessary mode of liberatory praxis, up to and including
    the use of organized violence. While James Connolly and Frantz Fanon were
    never directly linked, they are of a type, and this essay marks a small
    first step towards bringing their work into a larger, productive synthesis.

  abstract: >-
    Putting Joyce back into dialogue with other Irish writers of his generation,
    this book shows that his experiments with narrative styles and structures
    were a renegotiation rather than a rejection of earlier Irish conventions.
    While Joyce is undoubtedly the best known, other Irish writers were also
    influenced by European movements in naturalism and decadence that were
    shaping European Modernism as it emerged in the 1890s. Reading Joyce's works
    in the context of often forgotten contemporaries such as George Moore,
    George Egerton, Hannah Lynch, Shan Bullock, Forrest Reid and Charlotte
    O’Conor Eccles enhances our understanding of their works as well as Joyce’s,
    both thematically and stylistically, and shines a much-needed light on
    previously critically underexamined writers. By focusing on the
    transformation of Joyce from Irish writer to Modernist artist we gain
    crucial insights into why many of Joyce’s contemporaries are not read today
    despite their initial popularity. This book utilises Joyce’s troubled
    publication and reception history to identify the wider trends of the Irish
    short story cycle and Bildungsroman, thereby enhancing readers’
    understanding of the literary marketplace for Irish books in this period.”

    The portrayal of Ireland on screen has been problematic due to a lack of a
    sustained indigenous film industry before the establishment of the Irish
    Film Board in 1980 and the Northern Ireland Film Council in 1989. However,
    before this, many talented and proficient non-professional filmmakers were
    capturing events that hold valuable clues to an internal social and
    historical perspective on twentieth-century Ireland. ???????Northern Ireland
    has a rich heritage of amateur and independent cinema that includes several
    prolific filmmakers and collectives. Many of these image makers garnered
    awards on the prestigious international independent film circuit and had
    their work shown in film festivals and on television. Crucially, they
    offered an alternative and illuminating view to the mainstream-cinema and
    broadcast-media imagery of a conflicted region that was often filmed but
    little understood. They also laid the groundwork for the vibrant film
    culture that exists in Northern Ireland today. This book will offer the
    first scholarly exploration of these 'cine auteurs'.

  abstract: >-
    The Easter 1916 rebellion occasioned significant civilian casualties. Having
    initially resisted the idea of compensating bereaved or injured civilians,
    the British government relented by establishing the Rebellion (Victims’)
    Committee (RVC) which assessed 550 compensation applications for death and
    injury. Utilizing these applications as well as Dublin Castle, Treasury,
    press, and parliamentary records, this article examines five aspects of the
    state’s treatment of civilian casualties: why the government’s initial
    opposition to compensation was eventually reversed; the establishment of the
    RVC, the bureaucratic compensation process, and the surveillance of
    working-class claimants; what the compensation claims reveal about the
    nature and circumstances of civilian casualties during the rebellion; how
    the Workmen’s Compensation Act (1906) was used to determine compensation
    awards and, consequently, how this minimized the state’s financial
    liabilities by treating civilian casualties not as victims of war but on a
    par with injured workers; and, lastly, why the workmen’s compensation
    legislation was an inadequate means of treating civilian war casualties. The
    RVC compensation records enable a unique case study of how the 1916
    rebellion adversely affected the lives of ordinary men, women and children,
    and how the British state endeavoured to limit its obligations to make
    reparations to them.

  abstract: "If you know nothing about County Wexford, or know a lot, this book is equally appealing. County Wexford is commonly regarded as an anglicised county on the east coast of Ireland. Gaelic Wexford shatters that stereotype and presents an entirely fresh take on the history of the County, but written for the first time from an Irish language and Gaelic perspective. Three quarters of Wexford’s recorded history was lived entirely through Irish rather than English: yet that history has been silenced and invisibilised.\_\_Here in 450 pages, 400 colour illustrations, and four thousand footnotes, Wexford Is presented in an entirely new light. Fresh archival discoveries from libraries all over the world unveil Wexford in ways that have never been recorded before.\_Here for the first time, are detailed treatments of the quintessential Wexford families the Murphys, Doyles, Bolgers, Breens, Dorans, Keoghs, Kinsellas, Kavanaghs, and many more. The book offers a treasure trove of new genealogical sources - like a detailed listing by townland of over a thousand Wexford people in 1641, to vibrant portraits of colourful personalities: it also has a series of\_ freshly\_ recovered historical maps, including north Wexford in 1657 and a superb estate map from 1729 that covers the area from Enniscorthy to Wexford and new discoveries like the earliest drawing of the Hook lighthouse from 1730\_This volume explores the hidden history of Wexford: from big themes like its oak woods, coastline, and farmlands, to vivid vignettes of windmills, rabbit warrens, wolves and dovecots. It also offers detailed treatments of the history of Wexford, New Ross and Enniscorthy.\_This book offers a bold reimagining of the history of a remarkable county with a distinctive history and culture."

  abstract: >-
    Ireland’s historical coordinates are shifting, prompting a re-examination of
    national narratives and of the assumptions and anxieties that have kept them
    in place. Increasingly, stories that disturb rather than coalesce with grand
    narratives are the focus of historical study, revealing the structural
    violence used to maintain societal order. This article argues that tending
    to bigger questions about power and smaller ones about human experience
    creates space for new and diverse histories. It explores the dynamics that
    shaped the grand narratives central to Irish history and proposes the idea
    of imagined and lived encounters as a way of thinking about differentiation,
    the relational nature of power and its impact on experience and everyday
    life. An analysis of the concept of respectability is used to probe how
    power functions. The article concludes with a consideration of the
    historical archive broadly defined, highlighting the benefits of embracing
    the ‘unreliable’ witness, listening and accounting for silences, touching
    the material, and considering imagination as a force constantly at play in
    the encounters that shape history. The acceptance of this dynamic
    instability in historical research creates possibilities for new voices and
    perspectives to emerge.

    This article examines the Dublin House of Industry in the final decades of
    the eighteenth century. Established in 1773, the House of Industry was part
    of an effort to launch a nationwide system of workhouses and something like
    a poor law system for Ireland. By the 1790s however, there was a shift from
    the paternalistic governance of the founders of the house to a new way of
    managing the relief of the poor within the institution. During this decade,
    there emerged a new board of governors who adopted a supposed ‘scientific’
    approach to philanthropy. Influenced by the ideas of such workhouse
    reformers as Count Rumford in Munich, the new governors attempted to enact a
    sweeping series of changes to transform life in the workhouse along
    ‘oeconomical’ lines. It argues that these transformations reflected broader
    patterns of social change in the capital, as well as shifts in attitudes to
    poor relief more generally.

    This paper traces the textual afterlife of Frederic William Burton’s 1840
    watercolour A Blind Girl at A Holy Well to consider how periodicals and
    writers deployed the painting’s sentimental depiction of blindness as part
    of mid-century debates about Irish culture and nationhood. While the
    publications all agreed that the painting was emotionally moving and
    nationally significant, the character of those emotions and the definition
    of that nation differed according to each periodical’s political and
    religious aims, suggesting a flexible link in Victorian print culture
    between blindness and Irishness.

    An examination of the history of menageries in Ireland from 1790 to 1840
    offers insights into how people related to and understood the animal world
    through exhibitions of exotic creatures. Menageries, featuring diverse
    collections of wild animals displayed in cages, were part of the broader
    entertainment scene at fairs and large social events in the early nineteenth
    century. Journeying across Ireland and Britain in horse-drawn caravans,
    these exhibitions evolved from modest attractions to significant commercial
    enterprises by the mid nineteenth century. While British menageries of the
    period have received considerable scholarly attention, Irish menageries have
    been largely overlooked. This article seeks to address that gap by exploring
    how the Irish public encountered exotic and rare animals in menageries
    during this period. Newspapers, advertisements for travelling menageries and
    contemporary accounts reveal that menageries played a meaningful role in
    bringing the wonders of the animal kingdom to the Irish populace, offering a
    glimpse into the exotic and the unknown.

    Siege was the defining experience of the grindingly brutal and consequential
    Irish Wars of Religion (1641- 53). Civilians were more likely to encounter
    siege warfare as participants and as victims than any other kind of military
    action. Pá draig Lenihan, an acknowledged expert on the period, conveys this
    experience by examining survivor testimony contained in the 1641
    Depositions, the largest and most diverse body of direct and vivid accounts
    of the civilian exposure to war in the early modern period. Giving equal
    weight to the ' sharp end' of warfare and to ' war and society' issues such
    as recruitment, logistics and strategy, the author borrows and adapts
    methodologies from social and cultural history in order to understand how
    societies experience conflict and give meaning to it. These were religious
    wars and if all sides thought they glimpsed Heaven in the sky above them,
    they' d all spent time in Hell.

    This fully illustrated and authorised history marks fifty years of one of
    Ireland’s most ground-breaking and successful theatrical ensembles. Founded
    in 1975, Druid is a touring theatre company, anchored in the West of Ireland
    and looking to the world.Druid began as a bold idea: to create Ireland’s
    first professional theatre company outside of Dublin. There were few
    resources with which to achieve such an undertaking in the West of Ireland
    in 1975. Through sheer dedication, and with the support of the Galway
    community, founders Garry Hynes, Marie Mullen and Mick Lally – alongside a
    protean ensemble of actors, crew and supporters – made this bold idea a
    reality. That reality has since become an international success story of
    extraordinary dimensions.In this comprehensive history of the company,
    Patrick Lonergan weaves together decades of personal stories, archival
    material, anecdotes, memories and performances into a fascinating and
    illuminating portrait of one of the most vital institutions in Ireland’s
    theatrical landscape.

    The book explores the symbiotic relationship between Irish migrants and the
    built environment in England. In doing so the book draws out fresh aspects
    of the migration story, how it was supported through the use of different
    types of buildings and also demonstrates the opportunities that emigration
    offered to Irish communities.When emigrants travelled from Ireland to
    England their first connections with the country were not just with people,
    but also buildings. Buildings that housed the institutions and businesses
    that formed the support network for Irish people, many of them young and
    travelling alone.The themed chapters cover public and private buildings that
    reflect the various working and social lives of Irish people, including
    those that show the business acumen of migrants. It also explores buildings
    that supported informal networks – churches, pubs and community centres.And
    it documents buildings that demonstrate other sides to the standard
    migration narrative that it was only the poor and low or semi-skilled that
    migrated by looking at built heritage associated with Irish artists and
    workers in the creative industries.

    In 1903, the National Police Gazette wrote that Irish boxers were greeted by
    audiences with "a hearty cheer and earnest backing." For a time in the
    United States, the Irishman became the idealized boxer--the apotheosis of
    masculinity. The "Emperors of Masculinity," as author Gerard Earley
    described the leading heavyweight boxers of the era, had become Emerald
    Emperors. This book is the first in-depth study of the role played by the
    Irish and Irish Americans in U.S. boxing. It examines the lives of many men
    who contributed to the sport's development and looks at social, cultural,
    and historical facets of their lives and careers. It is a story of
    assimilation, achievement, and heartbreak in the most brutal sport of all.

    East Cork was a particularly violent area during the War of Independence
    with many IRA ambushes and attacks on Crown Forces. The first major success
    nationally for the IRA was the capture and destruction of Carrigtwohill RIC
    Barracks near Midleton. The IRA’s worst tragedy was at Clonmult, also near
    Midleton, when the East Cork flying column was wiped out. During the war,
    twenty-two members of the IRA, ten RIC and Black & Tans, thirteen British
    soldiers, and nine civilians lost their lives violently in East Cork.This
    book presents a balanced history of the war between the IRA and Crown Forces
    in East Cork, covering all areas of the district. Featuring extensive lists
    of participants and a rich collection of photographs and maps, this book
    uses original primary sources, contemporary newspapers and documents to
    provide real, personal accounts of the action in East Cork.

  abstract: >-
    For almost two millennia, the island of Ireland has continued to have an
    impact on European and English-speaking Christianity and culture out of all
    proportion to its size and position. This volume looks at key Irish figures,
    beyond lawyers and judges, whose ideas have impacted on the way law is
    conceived, conceptualised, and practised. The work consists of four Parts,
    each corresponding to a distinct historical phase. During the Early
    Mediaeval Period, Christian influence was visible both in Ireland’s brehon
    legal system and in the treatises which Irish monks wrote on subjects such
    as the law of war and how to rule as a Christian prince. In the
    post-mediaeval period, the Protestant Ascendancy required defenders of the
    new settlement, whose ideas would have ramifications for the colonisation of
    the New World. We also find Ireland producing thinkers of international
    stature such as Archbishop James Ussher, Bishop George Berkeley, and Edmund
    Burke, who set a trend of Irish influence throughout the English-speaking
    world. The struggle for independence in the nineteenth and early twentieth
    centuries produced the towering figures of Daniel O’Connell, Edward Carson,
    and Eamon de Valera, as well as Patrick Pearse, the lodestar of the Easter
    Rising in 1916. In the twentieth century, great Irish men and women who
    influenced English-speaking culture include C.S. Lewis, James Joyce, Richard
    O’Sullivan KC, and Herbert McCabe. They show the enduring importance of a
    commitment to reason and a desire for virtue against the backdrop of the
    conflicts, both domestic and international, which impacted Ireland. With
    contributions drawn from Irish, British, and North American scholars and
    lawyers, the diversity of international and methodological perspectives is a
    key strength of the volume. The book will appeal to scholars, lawyers, and
    students interested in the history of ideas, the interplay between religion
    and law, and Ireland as a place of contestation, experimentation, and
    generation of new ideas.

  abstract: >-
    This essay addresses the question of why Ireland's sheep and wool diminished
    in economic importance during an era in which they seemed to count so much
    for other states. From 1780 to 1800, the Irish Government and Parliament
    enjoyed greater autonomy to shape what Julian Hoppit describes as a
    ‘political economy of wool' but used it to discount sheep and wool. After
    the Union, there was a belated effort by Irish political elites to promote
    sheep and wool in Ireland's improvement, but it proved a spectacular
    failure. Integrating political economy and economic history, the essay shows
    the importance of wool in Ireland’s political dynamics and the profound
    impact of these politics on the economic history of Irish sheep and wool.

  abstract: >-
    The 1920s London-Irish Theatre: A History documents, explores and
    interrogates the Irish theatre that was prevalent in London during the
    1920s. This includes consideration of the movements that impacted 1920s
    London theatre, such as the influential repertory theatres of the first
    decade of the twentieth century, as well as the detailed history of the
    Irish Players. Each identified London-Irish production is discussed through
    contemporary theatre reviews from London newspapers and journals, and within
    the decade’s historical context. Dramatists, their plays, actors, producers,
    and the physical theatres are all considered as extensively as evidence
    allows. Major productions, like those of Lennox Robinson’s The White-Headed
    Boy, Sean O’Casey’s Juno and the Paycock, and Bernard Shaw’s Saint Joan with
    its distinct Irish echoes are considered, along with productions of George
    Shiels’ Professor Tim and Bernard Duffy’s The Counter Charm and more.
    Producers discussed include James Fagan and Charles Macdona, while
    considered actors include Sara Allgood, Maire O’Neill, Arthur Sinclair, Fred
    O’Donovan, Ellen O’Malley, Ethel O’Shea, and many more. This leads, for the
    first time, to a full portrait of the Irish theatre that was produced in
    London during the 1920s in not only the West End, but also in smaller London
    theatres and in suburban repertory theatres.

  abstract: >-
    History of education scholarship in the Republic of Ireland has witnessed a
    blossoming in recent years, a trajectory which diverges from broader
    international patterns. Expanding beyond its traditional focus on teacher
    education, recent scholarship has extended its theoretical, methodological
    and thematic foundations. This article traces the contours of the
    historiography of Irish education, highlighting dominant themes and
    intellectual trends. Focusing in particular on research relating to the
    period 1831 to 1975, it maps the scholarship across five inter-related
    motifs: the massification and democratisation of education; control and
    governance; gender; curriculum; and teachers and teacher education.
    Acknowledging there remain significant lacunae, in particular in relation to
    race and sexuality, we offer in the conclusion some suggestions for future
    avenues of research.
