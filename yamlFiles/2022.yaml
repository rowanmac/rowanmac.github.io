    Mediating Cultural Memory is the first book to analyze the relationship
    between cultural memory, national identity and the changing media ecology in
    early eighteenth-century Britain. Leith Davis focuses on five pivotal
    episodes in the histories of England, Scotland and Ireland: the 1688
    'Glorious' Revolution; the War of the Two Kings in Ireland (1688-91); the
    Scottish colonial enterprise in Darien (1695-1700); the 1715 Jacobite
    Rising; and the 1745 Jacobite Rising. She explores the initial inscription
    of these episodes in forms such as ballads, official documents, manuscript
    newsletters, correspondence, newspapers and popular histories, and examines
    how counter-memories of these events continued to circulate in later
    mediations. Bringing together Memory Studies, Book History and British
    Studies, Mediating Cultural Memory offers a new interpretation of the early
    eighteenth century as a crucial stage in the development of cultural memory
    and illuminates the processes of remembrance and forgetting that have shaped
    the nation of Britain.
