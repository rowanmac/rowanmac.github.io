    On a sunny day, men and women march through the streets wearing orange
    collarettes and carrying colourful banners. However, this is not the Orange
    Order in Northern Ireland but the same organisation in Africa. This book
    moves beyond the cliché to delve deeply into the inner structure and rituals
    of the Orange Order and its global reach. The Orange Order, while Irish
    Protestant-founded, managed in a short period to spread to not only other
    parts of the UK, but also to Australia, New Zealand and even Africa.
    Previous research has tended to focus on just one to two countries within a
    narrow timeframe. This book, by contrast, covers almost 230 years of the
    Orange Order across multiple countries. Unlike other studies, it integrates
    the activities of men, women and children.

    This article examines the implementation of physical education in Ireland’s
    reformatory and industrial schools, which were established in the latter
    half of the nineteenth century. It will focus on the years from 1858 until
    shortly after the partition of Ireland in 1921, while acknowledging the
    general bias towards the role of authorities in official reports. It will
    identify the systems of physical education utilised in these schools and
    will offer a comparison with primary and intermediate schools in the
    pre-partition years. It will show that external and internal drill
    instructors were utilised and that pupils participated in physical displays
    to highlight the progress made and to encourage discipline. Some also took
    part in competitions held before dignitaries and patrons, and at times made
    use of local facilities. In this way, the reformatory and industrial school
    education systems were not unlike more mainstream schools in those years,
    but facilities were often limited and lacked the development of those in
    more affluent intermediate schools.

    When Theobald Wolfe Tone arrived in France in February 1796, intent on
    securing French help to win Irish independence from England and to establish
    a republic in Ireland, his greatest challenge was not to convince the
    Directory to launch an expedition to Ireland, but in persuading them that
    the Irish were mature enough to become republicans and were not mere
    Chouans. Was Tone deluded and did he embellish the revolutionary potential
    of the Irish, especially the secret society of the Defenders, as the
    dominant (revisionist) historiography claims? A close look at the available
    sources, and a new reading against the grain, or under a ‘satanic light’, of
    the available sources, allows us to better delineate what could have been an
    Irish republic or, at least, to situate the Defenders within an Atlantic
    context of popular politicisation – the ‘Atlantic Republic’.

    There is much to learn from modern left-wing activism in Ireland. A rich
    tapestry of movements, including republicans, social democrats, trade
    unions, Trotskyists and anarchists, they have been battling neoliberalism
    and austerity with vigour, frustration, success and failure.Fragments of
    Victory charts these political currents, from the difficult early years of
    anti-austerity campaigning, to the successful mass campaign to end water
    charges and prevent water privatisation, and the seismic victory that was
    'Repeal' - the campaign for women’s reproductive rights. Looking to the
    present, the campaign around the brutal housing crisis is also
    addressed.Each chapter covers a different campaign or group, written by
    leading activists who provide insiders' perspectives on how history was
    made, and share valuable insights that can be applied to international
    movements everywhere.

    Irish Literature in Transition is the first volume in a six-volume series
    covering literature from 1700 to the present, which, according to a general
    opening statement, aims to capture “the dynamic energies transmitted over
    more than 300 years of the established literary landmarks that constitute
    Irish literary life.” The goals of the series will strike as pertinent and
    wise to those eighteenth-century scholars for whom the temporal, and indeed,
    cultural boundaries of their chosen field have always been unstable and
    somewhat arbitrary, awkwardly encompassing as they do a number of
    much-discussed transitions, from Restoration to Augustan literatures, to
    literatures of Sensibility and Romanticism. Specifically Irish evolutions
    are at issue in this volume, which very compellingly accounts for
    linguistic, political, religious, philosophical, geographical, genre, and
    gender ambiguities and transitions borne by the Irish eighteenth century,
    conceived in the longest sense. The volume casts light upon new writers and
    streams of thought until recently neglected in eighteenth-century and Irish
    studies.

  abstract: >-
    The 1930s was a period of profound crisis for Irish dry cattle farmers.
    Understandably, many blamed the then Fianna Fáil government, which
    instigated a trade dispute with Britain and harboured a deep aversion to the
    cattle trade. In this context, many viewed the government's decision to
    reduce the cattle herd in 1934 as part of a grand plan to upend largescale
    cattle farming. As this article demonstrates, the situation was far more
    complex. The government certainly sought to reform Irish agriculture but was
    unwilling to preside over the complete collapse of the cattle trade. The
    Irish government's intransigence played a part, but the worst years of the
    crisis also owed much to British protectionism. Yet, notwithstanding the
    conditions, farmers stubbornly stuck to cattle.

  abstract: >-
    This essay aims to examine the most characteristic aspect of the
    nineteenth-century Anglophone theatre, its dominance by the adaptation of
    French plays. It lays out some of the underlying theatrical conditions in
    both Paris and London, and examines the British discourse about adaptation,
    which covered a spectrum from condemnation to roguish delight. Using two
    case studies, John Buckstone’s The Irish Lion and Dion Boucicault’s The
    Corsican Brothers, the essay argues that “adaptation from the French” was
    not a singular or consistent process. It could range instead from the
    appropriation of a single idea to something close to direct translation.
    More than this, the essay suggests that attention to adaptive processes can
    illuminate national difference, cultural equivalence, and aspects of theatre
    history. Thus it becomes clear that the Irish Lion transforms a spoof on the
    Parisian celebrity of Jean-Jacques Rousseau into a joke about the London
    lionization of the Irish poet Thomas Moore. Meanwhile, close examination of
    The Corsican Brothers reveals that the most famous ghostly effects of
    Charles Kean’s 1852 staging were not solely attributable to Boucicault, or
    to Kean. Instead, they responded to the dramaturgy of Eugène Grangé and
    Xavier de Montépin, who adapted the novel by Alexandre Dumas père for the
    Parisian Théâtre Historique. In this case, the most critical work was not
    translation, but transmediation. At the same time, adaptation was
    necessarily responsive to local expectations. The Corsican Brothers
    reflected cultural shifts occasioned by the Theatres Act of 1843, and fed a
    new British appetite for “gentlemanly melodrama.” Above all, the dominance
    of “adaptation from the French” relied on personal links and cultural
    parallels which tied London to Paris, not least in the reputational likeness
    observable between Boucicault and Dumas.

    This article compares the attitude of the Irish government in power in the
    early 1920s towards two differing judicial institutions that were omitted
    from the Courts of Justice Act 1924. This pioneering legislation created the
    system of courts that largely persists in the modern Irish State. The first
    object of comparison concerns the attitude of the Irish government of this
    period towards the ‘Dáil courts’ that had been created by Irish nationalist
    authorities in 1920 in opposition to the official courts of the United
    Kingdom in Ireland. The second concerns governmental attitudes towards the
    appeal from the Irish courts to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,
    the final appellate court for most of the British Commonwealth and Empire.
    This article argues that the sidelining of these differing institutions by
    this important legislation has more shared features than is immediately
    apparent. Both institutions were influenced by the 1922 Constitution of the
    Irish Free State. The Irish government accused both judicial institutions of
    incompetence and bias in interpreting Irish law. Their common
    marginalization by the Courts of Justice Act 1924 also reflects dual
    political challenges facing the Irish government in the early 1920s.

    The era of the Troubles in Belfast brought both challenges to free movement
    and grassroots responses to such challenges. The conflict itself inspired
    divisions and barriers to mobility within the city, notably including the
    establishment of British Army checkpoints and the construction of various
    “peace walls” under the direction of the British Government. While the
    geospatial significance of the Troubles remains a popular and necessary
    subject of discourse within scholarship on the conflict, less attention has
    been given to considering its relative impact on people's daily lives.
    Interrogating the question of impartiality in conflict-related polices, such
    as the Falls Road Curfew and internment, helps contextualize
    disproportionate disruptions to mobility in the city. Additionally,
    conflict-related violence frequently impacted access to transportation,
    contributing to community-based initiatives to improve movement throughout
    the city, notably the introduction of black taxi services in the 1970s. By
    focusing on Belfast during the Troubles, this article considers the
    relationships among free movement, conflict, governments, and
    community-based responses to such challenges.

    Official Voices: Poets and the Irish State examines the poet-politicians and
    bureaucrats who shaped the twenty-six-county Irish state, from its
    pre-history in the revolutionary period through its foundation in 1922 and
    complicated modernisation in the 1960s to the outbreak of the Troubles.
    Poet-officials juggled writing the state and navigating the force-field
    between poetry and politics, with poetic form registering the aftershocks of
    this collusive antagonism. Combining political history, cultural history and
    literary criticism, the book grapples with major issues in the state’s
    history: revolution, state violence/insurgency against the state,
    patriarchy, partition, modernisation, as well as socialist and feminist
    alternatives to conservative nationalism. Poets examined in the book include
    W.B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, Desmond FitzGerald, Denis Devlin, Joseph Campbell,
    Valentin Iremonger, Eithne Strong, Máire Mhac an tSaoi and Thomas Kinsella.
    It draws on new archival work in state archives and literary collections,
    and situates the Irish state and Irish poetry within a transnational frame.
    Taking up the relationship of poetry to politics, and poet-officials to
    state governance, it tackles a perennial question: what did poetry make
    happen (and not happen) in the twenty-six counties? This book is about
    acknowledged legislators, poetry’s formal vigilance, and how poets
    apprehended, consciously and unconsciously, the recalcitrant workings of
    power.

  abstract: >-
    The Nine Years War (1593-1603), sometimes known as Tyrone's Rebellion, was
    one of the most devastating and brutal conflicts to sweep the island. Never
    would the English Crown come so close to losing its grip on Ireland. It was
    brought on by a combination of English misrule, Irish ambition and the
    fortuitous creation of political ties with Spain. A confederation of Irish
    lords led by the charismatic and exceptionally gifted Hugh O'Neill, Earl of
    Tyrone, swept from one victory to another. Part 1 of this series will
    examine the years of Irish triumph as English nonchalance turned to
    disbelief and then panic as Irish armies engaged with and defeated all
    attempts by the Crown to restore English authority.Tyrone duped the English
    state into believing it was engaged in a local affair against Hugh Maguire,
    lord of Fermanagh, for the first two years of the war. While the English
    fought a shooting war in the west of Ulster, Tyrone raised an unprecedented
    confederation of Irish lords that set aside parochial self-interest to mount
    a concerted and coordinated effort to eject English power from Ireland once
    and for all.Time and again, English armies were engaged and defeated by
    modernised Irish forces fighting with a skill and technical sophistication
    never before seen. This series of Crown defeats came to a bloody climax at
    the battle of the Yellow Ford on 14 August 1598. The Irish shattered the
    English field army in a matter of hours. Its commander, Henry Bagenal, was
    killed along with almost half his men. The battle remains the greatest
    defeat given to the English by Irish arms and a striking reverse to a period
    often seen as Elizabeth's Golden Age.

    This publication presents the excavations at Rathgall, Rath East, Co.
    Wicklow, conducted by Barry Raftery, retired Professor of Celtic Archaeology
    at University College Dublin. Raftery published aspects of the site,
    primarily in the 1970s (Raftery 1970a; 1970b; 1971; 1972; 1973; 1975; 1976;
    2004; Raftery and Henderson 1987), and was working on a comprehensive
    account but fell ill and passed away before he could finalize the
    publication or integrate the results of the specialist analysis. The present
    volume aims to present his work and to integrate it with these new data,
    augmented and expanded in a final phase of post-excavation analysis
    conducted between 2010 and 2013.Raftery's voice is conserved in this as much
    as possible. In places, editorial comments add new information or
    clarifications. In other sections, his draft text is presented and
    juxtaposed with the discussion of alternative scenarios that emerged in the
    recent phase of post-excavation work. In fact, significant parts of the
    post-excavation analysis were finalized as part of this last phase of the
    publication project, including the finalization and integration of site
    drawings and photographsRaftery's discussion of aspects of the site is
    presented as topical discussions where draft text was present in the
    archive. He also left a list of questions or 'points to ponder', and it is
    hoped that the work done as part of this project will provide answers to
    some of these.

  abstract: >-
    From the inception of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, Irish women
    and men were actively recruited to train and work as nurses in British
    hospitals. By the 1960s approximately 30,000 Irish-born nurses were working
    across the NHS, constituting around 12% of all nursing staff. While many
    Irish families produced at least one nurse and many of those emigrated, so
    far there has been little recognition of the enormous contribution of Irish
    nurses to health care in Britain. Based on 45 interviews, this book tells
    the stories of Irish nurses in their own words using rich oral history and
    photographs. From the rigours of training to the fun of dancehalls, the book
    explores their life experiences as nurses and also as Irish migrants in
    British society.

  abstract: >-
    In 1660 Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Scotland and
    Ireland, but his hold on power was precarious. In particular, Ireland was
    fundamentally unstable - Catholics formed the majority of the population in
    a country where Protestantism was the established religion, a state of
    affairs unique in Europe. It was through the law that the restored Stuart
    monarchy governed its subjects and its colonial dependencies, and this book
    examines how Catholics engaged with and experienced English common law
    primarily through the eyes of Catholic clerics and Gaelic poets. It also
    examines how Catholics engaged with the Courts and the particular challenges
    they faced as lawyers. The book draws on an extensive body of primary source
    materials, including Irish-language poetry and little-used archival material
    relating to elite Catholic families.

    This article explores Rosamond Jacob’s The Troubled House (1938) and Dorothy
    Macardle’s The Uninvited (1942), two works of fiction that employ a gothic
    aesthetic to confront readers with the failings of a republican movement to
    which they had actively contributed. If providing distinctive perspectives
    on revolution, war, and nation-building, both novels similarly employ the
    gothic to draw our attention to the pathology of venerating motherhood while
    ignoring the complex realities of Irish women’s lives. Read together, The
    Troubled House and The Uninvited exemplify the fruitful ways that a gothic
    aesthetic can simultaneously elicit a broad readership while delivering a
    dissident message that many readers would not otherwise wish to hear.

    In Filthy Queens, Dr Christina Wade looks at the history of beer alongside
    some of the biggest events in the story of Ireland. You’ll find 18th-century
    courtesans who had a wicked streak of beer snobbery and early medieval monks
    who wrote beer reviews so terrible any Untappd fan would feel right at
    home.   There will be beer tastings, parties, music and wakes. You’ll meet
    thieves and murderers, saints and goddesses. You’ll hear stories of kings
    and paupers, witches and bishops, Irish, English and Vikings from the Late
    Iron Age all the way up to the early 20th century. And don’t forget the
    rules, from medieval edicts about malt quality to early modern water
    regulations. Of course, there will be some marked differences, notably the
    human sacrifice. And the zombies.  Throughout the book, Christina also makes
    connections to tangible links to the past, whether it’s buildings that still
    dot the landscape, artefacts in museums, things you pass on your daily
    commute or the pint glass you drink out of. We’ve been drinking beer for
    millennia, so it’s a perfect way to embrace the past and those who lived in
    it. In the end, you’ll see that the history of beer is intimately
    intertwined with the history of us.

    While the impacts of Irish emigration to America following the Great Famine
    of 1845–1852 have been well studied, comparatively little scholarly
    attention has been paid to the effects of reverse migration on Irish
    culture, society, and politics. Inspired by the work of historian David P.
    B. Fitzpatrick (1948–2019) and forming a companion to his final published
    work The Americanisation of Ireland: Migration and Settlement 1841–1925
    (Cambridge, 2019), this volume explores the influence of America in shaping
    Ireland's modernisation and globalisation. The essays use the concept of
    Americanisation to explore interdisciplinary themes of material culture,
    marketing, religion, politics, literature, cinema, music, and folklore.
    America in Ireland reveals a late nineteenth and early twentieth-century
    Irish society that was more cosmopolitan than previously assumed, in which
    'Returned Yanks' brought home new-fangled notions of behaviour and
    activities and introduced their families to American products, culture and
    speech. In doing so, this book demonstrates the value of a transnational and
    global perspective for understanding Ireland's history.

  abstract: >-
    For decades, transnational knowledge circulation in relation to schooling in
    Ireland has been a neglected area of study among historians. This paper
    provides new insights through a transnational lens on primary, secondary,
    and vocational curriculum developments in the first decade following the
    advent of national independence in the country in 1922. During this period,
    key policy-makers largely rejected progressive educational ideas circulating
    internationally and promoted curricula and pedagogy in primary and secondary
    schools that reflected the new nation’s deeply conservative Catholic nature
    and nationalist ethos. While initial signs indicated that developments in
    vocational education might head in a different direction, ultimately, more
    progressive educational ideas circulating internationally were excluded from
    that sector as well. At all levels of the education system, the hegemony of
    the Catholic Church and other contextual factors resulted in traditional and
    conservative curricula that underpinned policy and practice until the 1960s.
