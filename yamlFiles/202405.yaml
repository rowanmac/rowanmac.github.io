    The first historical overview of the study of languages in Ireland from an
    expert in the area. How history shifts languages and languages in turn shape
    history is a deep-rooted, dynamic process manifest in Victorian Ireland. In
    Foreign Tongues, Phyllis Gaffney sheds new light on this period of Irish
    history, exploring how continental influences that predated the Penal Laws
    were reinvigorated in the wake of the French Revolution. An influx of
    foreign teachers and religious orders created institutions for an emerging
    élite, and University education expanded. At the same time, civil service
    reforms opened careers across the British Empire to graduates from all
    religions. The result is that Ireland’s Victorian colleges embraced language
    study—ancient and modern, Irish and European—more eagerly than their British
    counterparts. An adaptive, fast-changing academic landscape laid the
    groundwork for today’s Ireland—culturally confident, open to Europe and the
    world—while the dramatic rise of the Gaelic League forged a bond between
    language, education, and politics with pervasive effects on Irish identities
    in the twentieth century. None of that was plain sailing. Gaffney’s profiles
    of individual professors reveal pioneering scholarship, precarious careers,
    sudden scandals, and denunciations and dismissals linked to local conflicts
    and foreign wars. On the positive side, the advance of women’s education
    cleared the path for a cohort of notable female professors across modern
    languages. This wide-ranging, detailed study draws on multiple sources to
    cast a fresh light on aspects of Irish history, viewed through the complex
    lens of language education.

    This paper evaluates the prevalence and impact of nativist and anti-labor
    narratives built on the claim that the ‘Molly Maguires’, a vague 1860s and
    70s militant Irish labor phenomenon of the Pennsylvania anthracite region,
    was still active between the 1880s and the 1910s. It finds that such
    narratives were widespread until the late 1890s, and still regionally
    significant until the late 1900s, finally fading into obscurity in the
    1910s. ‘Molly Maguirism’ as a media narrative was primarily directed at
    organized labor and the (Irish) working class; it is best understood as a
    form of ethnicized proto-Red Scare tactic, but could incorporate other
    elements, such as broader nativist ideology and sectarianism. Based on these
    findings, prevailing models of Irish acculturation, such as Painter’s
    ‘second enlargement of whiteness’, are obsolete; the paper recommends a
    thorough revision of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Irish
    American working-class history, accounting for the continued and hitherto
    massively underestimated presence of anti-Irish sentiment.
