    This article considers the persistent inattention to the activity of James
    Joyce’s female family members in supporting his creative and compositional
    process. Using the discovery of the source for an early letter by Nora
    Barnacle to James Joyce as the article’s central example, it shows how Joyce
    scholarship has inadvertently perpetuated misogynistic assumptions and
    overlooked the creative labour of Joyce’s female family members – especially
    Barnacle – in the composition of his works. Building on recent public
    engagement work by Clare Hutton which highlights important archival
    documents penned by women who supported Joyce, the present article instead
    returns to Joyce’s published archive to expose the overlooked labour of
    women in his letters and manuscript drafts. In illuminating the practical
    and emotional tasks undertaken by Joyce’s wife, mother, aunt, daughter and
    daughter-in-law, this article elucidates the personal network Joyce utilised
    variously to push publication opportunities, acquire source and reading
    materials, and promote his public image.

  abstract: >-
    Most scholars believe that Spenser’s View was written in 1596. This study
    indicates that it is a 1596 amalgamation of two elements: one drafted about
    1589 when an optimistic Spenser portrayed the controversial actions of Lord
    Grey de Wilton in Ireland as a humanist enterprise; the other composed in
    1596 when a panic-stricken Spenser, believing England’s control over Ireland
    to be in jeopardy, argued for the appointment of a new governor, backed by a
    fresh cohort of English Protestant officials, who would revive the abandoned
    policies of Grey. Each element of the text proposed actions that may have
    seemed extreme to educated people in England. However, it is shown how the
    successive denigration by Spenser’s interlocutors of the Gaelic, the Old
    English and the English Protestant elements of Ireland’s population,
    reflected opinions that were widespread among English settlers in Ireland.
    For them experience was the most reliable source of knowledge.

    "The Oxford History of the Irish Book, Volume II: The Printed Book in Irish,
    1567-2010s is the second volume in Oxford's signature, five-volume History
    of the Irish Book series. With eighty-two chapters by seventy leading
    commentators on, and participants in, Irish book history, this volume spans
    almost five hundred years of Irish-language book printing, production,
    publication, distribution, and reception. It begins with the 1567
    publication of John Carswell's Gaelic version of the Book of Common Order
    and follows the story of the printed book (and journalism) in Irish into the
    twenty-first century, the internet, ebooks, and other formats. This volume
    covers religious publications from the sixteenth to eighteenth century,
    competing versions of Irish history, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
    texts which reflected an 'antiquarian' interest in Ireland and its culture,
    ongoing literary production in the nineteenth century, printers, publishers,
    literacy, books and volumes produced by learned societies interested in
    Irish language and culture, Gaelic Revival publications, post-Independence
    literature and its publishers, journalism from the late eighteenth to
    twenty-first century, lexicography, nonfiction, educational publishing,
    folklore and place lore, translation, the contribution of scholars from
    outside Ireland, publishing in the Irish diaspora, typography, book design
    and illustration, the reception of Irish-language texts (from censorship to
    bestseller status), book collection, and, finally, sources for the study of
    Irish book history"--

  abstract: >-
    More Irish personnel served in the Italian campaign than in any theatre of
    the Second World War. The greatest numbers were in the Army but airmen and
    sailors also played important roles. From the first actions in Sicily on 10
    July 1943 until the German surrender in Italy on 2 May 1945, Irish personnel
    were in the front line. Those in the combat support services also gave
    outstanding service, as did medical officers, nurses and chaplains. Many
    were decorated. At least one was recommended for a posthumous Victoria Cross
    and there were numerous awards of the DSO, DCM, MC and MM as well as
    Mentions in Despatches. For most there were no decorations, only the Italy
    Star; and the service of many was marked only by a headstone or a name on a
    memorial. Their stories are equally inspiring and deserve to be told whether
    they were tankmen, gunners, sappers, signallers, infantry or the faithful
    members of support services such as drivers and mechanics or nurses who were
    often under threat from air attack or artillery fire. At the other end of
    the spectrum, many of the commanders, including General Montgomery, Admiral
    Cunningham and Field Marshal Alexander were also Irish. Drawing on personal
    memoirs, published works, official records and interviews with veterans, as
    well as his own in-depth knowledge of the Italian campaign, Richard Doherty
    reveals the service of Irish units and Irish personnel of all ranks and
    throughout the campaign, especially during the major battles.

  abstract: >-
    One of the most important formative influences on Bram Stoker was Edward
    Dowden, who as a young don had befriended and impressed the barely younger
    man, introducing him to the work of Walt Whitman. While Catherine Wynne and
    Adam Putz have recently observed the relation between Dowden’s criticism of
    the Victorian stage, and the Irish don’s relation with Irving, few have
    observed how Stoker’s own fiction is suffused with Dowden’s somewhat
    sectarian ideas in relation to literature and art, as well as his more
    progressive views on gender. In this article, there will be a discussion of
    the role played by Stoker in promoting Dowden’s fame abroad, the ways in
    which Dowden’s work on Shakespeare contributed to the framing of both
    Renaissance culture and gender relations in Stoker’s novel The Mystery of
    the Sea (1902), and how Dowden’s own appreciation of Stoker’s later novel
    The Man (1905) aids the modern reader in navigating that work’s main ideas.
    Therefore, while Dowden benefited greatly from the networking of his quondam
    student and friend, the intellectual influence of the Irish don on the
    author of Dracula was also seminal to Stoker’s worldview, as presented in
    his later novels.

  abstract: >-
    Conflict is a well-trod theme in the study of nineteenth-century Ireland and
    ‘the Irish’. While this is especially clear in the more traditional fields
    of politics, religion and the military, conflict was equally manifest in
    every arena of Irish people’s lives, both in Ireland and abroad, including
    in areas such as gender, class, culture and identity in domestic or personal
    spaces, institutional life, education and medicine. Yet, despite a broad and
    multi-disciplinary historiography, this is the first book to focus solely on
    this rich theme.New Perspectives on Conflict and Ireland in the Nineteenth
    Century brings together a group of scholars based around the world and in
    multiple disciplines who engage with the manifestations, representations and
    histories of conflict pertaining to Ireland and Irish people throughout the
    long nineteenth century.

  abstract: >-
    This paper argues how postcolonial melancholia, as defined by Paul Gilroy,
    haunts attempts within Belfast to use public art to move past the trauma
    from the Troubles and colonialism’s lingering impact. We begin by addressing
    the history of political murals and re-imaging projects where public art is
    used to soften Belfast’s sectarian imagery. We then explore recent efforts
    by street artists to re-image the city to make it more amenable to tourists
    and middle-class patrons. We conclude with the reflections from promoters,
    artists, and graffiti writers regarding the role of public art as they
    oscillate between acknowledging the impossible task of art moving beyond
    historical trauma, political upheaval, and colonialism and idealised notions
    of art. An overarching middle-class vision of art and the neoliberal
    approaches of using it to bolster the city as a tourist destination fit
    awkwardly within the postcolonial melancholia that continues to trouble
    Belfast.

  abstract: >-
    Examines common themes and connections in Gaelic storytelling from the
    Middle Ages to present day. From the great medieval saga Táin Bó Cúailnge to
    cautionary folk tales in contemporary Gaeltacht areas, storytelling has
    remained a cornerstone of Gaelic culture for over a thousand years.
    Pre-Christian motifs and ecclesiastical influences, with nods to classical
    literature and poetic devices, provide the framework for many stories that
    remain familiar today (such as St Patrick's journey across Ireland and the
    exploits of Finn mac Cumhaill). However, despite this rich tradition,
    scholarship on Gaelic storytelling that crosses both medieval and modern
    fields is a rarity; as a result, there is a question mark over what of the
    early tradition remains in the modern, and what this can tell us about the
    ecology and the survival of Gaelic storytelling. This volume presents
    ground-breaking research from scholars in both areas, providing a dynamic
    insight into the refractions of Gaelic storytelling across a broad
    chronological period. Contributors address matters such as composition,
    style, narrative techniques, audience, and the importance of physical and
    social landscapes, drawing on a variety of methodologies, including
    philological, narratological, comparative literature, folkloristic, and
    translation studies. From seminal research on notions of scél "story" and
    truth to an exploration of the issues facing a Gaelic translator today,
    these essays work together to widen and deepen our understanding of how and
    why stories were so fundamental - and remain so fundamental - to Gaelic
    culture.

  abstract: >-
    Working-Class Women in Irish Literature and Theatre critically engages with
    works of theatre both by and about working-class women, historically and
    presently. Addressing professional and community theatre productions, from
    both textual and performative perspectives, this volume focuses on works of
    theatre by practitioners, directors, playwrights, and performance artists
    across rural and urban contexts. Irish theatre has a long history of
    signifying social class. Yet the representations of working-class women in
    Irish theatrical history also encompass several problematic issues, starting
    with the fact that these depictions were created by male writers like J. M
    Synge and Seán O'Casey to name but a few. Nonetheless, the theatre’s
    emphasis on embodied performance and its ability to reach its public in an
    unmediated way has attracted working-class engagement perhaps more than
    other art forms in Ireland. Contemporary playwrights in the Republic and the
    north of Ireland have tirelessly striven to illuminate working-class women’s
    lived experiences and have reframed the characterisation of working-class
    women by drawing out the intersection of social class with sexualities,
    ethnic minorities, and racial identities. This edited collection also
    includes the voices of directors, playwrights, and performers who identify
    with a working-class social background, offering first-hand accounts of
    their lived experience in the theatre industry.

  abstract: >-
    Dalkey, lying on the coast of South Dublin, is one of the most picturesque
    and affluent areas of all of Ireland. It has been home to some of Ireland's
    most well-known writers, authors and musicians, from George Bernard Shaw and
    Robert Fisk to Bono and Enya.This book is aimed at both the general reader
    and those with a particular interest in local history of the area. The time
    period extends from the earliest settlement about 5,000 BC to the present
    day, covering Dalkey, Bullock and Dalkey Island. The second part deals with
    the urban development of Dalkey in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries,
    in relation to topics such as housing, transport, and services. The final
    two chapters provide brief pen-pictures of people who either helped shape
    its development or who made a mark in their chosen careers. Each chapter is
    illustrated with historic maps, engravings, paintings and photos.

  abstract: >-
    Sean O'Casey is one of Ireland's best-known writers. He is the most
    frequently performed playwright in the history of the Irish National
    Theatre, and his work is often revived onstage elsewhere. O'Casey is also
    widely studied in schools, colleges, and universities in the
    English-speaking world. This book offers a new contextualisation of this
    famous writer's work, revisiting his association with Irish nationalism,
    historical revisionism, and celebrated contemporaries such as W. B. Yeats
    and Lady Gregory. The volume also brings O'Casey's work into contact with
    topics including disability studies, gender and sexuality, post-colonialism,
    ecocriticism, and race. Sean O'Casey in Context explores a number of
    existing ideas about O'Casey in the light of new academic developments, and
    updates our understanding of this important writer by taking into account
    recent scholarly thinking and a range of theatrical productions from around
    the globe.

  abstract: >-
    This article explores how McClinton’s Colleen Soap used the figure of the
    colleen to craft Irishness in its marketing through advertisements in the
    British and Irish press (1910–1923). Using visual social semiotic analysis,
    it examines the co-deployment of language, image, colour, typography, layout
    and composition to articulate and negotiate representations of Irishness and
    its evolution over time. Ultimately, it reveals the various ways in which
    Irish identity was self-fashioned and presented to both British and Irish
    audiences, drawing on contemporary political issues and the concept of
    “civilised whiteness,” thus demonstrating the fluid, fragile and sometimes
    fictitious nature of national identity. McClinton’s Colleen Soap, therefore,
    serves as a rich case study for examining how Irishness was continuously
    reinvented, reimagined and remarketed, and how a small Ulster company
    navigated its relationship with the British Empire during a turbulent period
    in its history.

  abstract: >-
    This article seeks to challenge dominant narratives surrounding the Great
    Hunger in Ireland (An Gorta Mór, 1845–1852) by focusing on the
    often-overlooked aspect of marine resource exploitation. Traditional
    historiography of the famine typically centres on the failure of the potato
    crop, British colonial policies and the resulting socio-economic
    devastations. However, this narrative largely omits the daily survival
    strategies and forms of resistance employed by the Irish populace,
    particularly in their interaction with the marine environment. This study
    explores how coastal communities turned towards the sea as a resource for
    sustenance, autonomy and resistance against oppressive conditions imposed by
    the crop failures and British colonial rule. By critically engaging with the
    role of colonial control, external aid efforts and local resistance in
    primary accounts, the authors argue that marine resources played an
    important role in the everyday survival of Irish communities in the face of
    systemic failures.
