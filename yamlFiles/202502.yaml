    This paper is a review of existing sources across disciplines focusing on
    the topic of female farm ownership. Throughout the centuries, females have
    been explicitly excluded from owning and prevented from inheriting land. The
    purpose of this paper is to examine historical customs and rules governing
    female land ownership in Ireland and to demonstrate how the ‘old’ laws and
    customs have contributed significantly to the patriarchal system of farm
    ownership that is still in existence today even though the gender-based laws
    have disappeared. This paper argues that a contributing factor to the
    current male-dominated farm ownership figures is the normalisation of
    patriarchy by way of the old, gendered laws and practices. Although gender
    discrimination is no longer acceptable in such a direct legal form, the
    tradition and culture that established and supported such customs can still
    be seen today, as males account for 87% of Irish farmholders. This research
    addresses a lacuna in our understanding of women’s unequal position when it
    comes to the ownership of farms in Ireland.

    In 1014, at the famous Battle of Clontarf, the High King of Ireland, Brian
    Boru, in conjunction with the provincial chiefs, defeated the colonizing
    Norsemen in a decisive battle which ended their efforts to conquer Ireland.
    At this time Clontarf was open countryside bordered by the Irish Sea. In the
    1,000 years that followed, Clontarf has grown and thrived into a modern
    urban centre, yet tranquil and proud of its heritage. In this work,
    best-selling author Joe Curtis explores that history in an accessible,
    visual narrative, including archive photographs, postcards and records.

    Award-winning journalist and bestselling author Martin Dillon returns to
    shine a light on the role of women in the Troubles, amplifying voices long
    silenced by the din of history.Through raw and compelling testimonies from
    both sides of the community, Dillon explores the overlooked perspectives of
    women whose lives were impacted by the brutal conflict. Some were directly
    involved in violence as members of paramilitary organisations. Many
    witnessed the ruthless murders of family members. All were profoundly and
    irrevocably affected by the violence and its aftermath.Former IRA
    volunteers, the wife of notorious UDA Commander Stevie ‘Top Gun’ McKeag, a
    survivor of the 1974 Dublin bombings and the daughter of a murdered judge
    share their stories among many others, their words reverberating with the
    intensity of their experiences.Dillon also unmasks the shadowy dealings of
    British intelligence and the impact of collusion on unsolved murders,
    exposing the layers of deception that have haunted families and
    communities.The Sorrow and the Loss is an eye-opening exploration of the
    previously unwritten history of the Troubles, challenging readers to
    confront the harsh realities of a conflict where truth and justice remain
    elusive.

    The sources formally documenting how tax policy evolves fail to capture many
    of the complexities inherent in such processes. Insights into such
    approaches would guide other tax administrations in navigating tax policy
    change in an international domain. This paper examines the historical
    background to the introduction of the Irish 12.5 percent corporate tax rate
    in 2003 in the face of the European Union’s (EU) dissatisfaction with the
    existing regime. A low corporate tax rate has long been seen as a critical
    element of the country’s industrial development strategy. Employing an oral
    history method to identify the perspectives and objectives of those involved
    in the policymaking process, we provide a case study of how one tax
    administration resolved what was seen as a particularly significant public
    policy dilemma.

    Ogam is well known as a writing system invented for the Irish language and
    used extensively for inscriptions on stone monuments across Ireland and
    Britain between the late fourth and seventh centuries. Although the script
    has primarily been examined in the context of early medieval archaeology and
    epigraphy, its long afterlife as an integral part of Irish manuscript
    culture from the medieval to modern periods has also been acknowledged. The
    present contribution seeks to add to the existing scholarship on manuscript
    ogam by discussing the transmission of ideas about the script as a cryptic
    device into the nineteenth century, with a particular focus on a recently
    discovered notebook, National Library of Scotland (Edinburgh) Advocates’
    Manuscript 50.3.11 (or ‘The Minchin Manuscript’), which consists almost
    entirely of healing charms written in ogam.

  abstract: >-
    Long recognized as Ireland's greatest demographic disaster in recent
    history, the Great Famine of 1845–1851 has shaped Irish identities around
    the world. From the monuments erected to commemorate its victims to the
    political rhetoric involving it to the novels, poems, songs, and films that
    it continues to inspire, the Famine remains a crucial part of Irish memory.
    Famine memories have also reached across history and national borders to
    establish links with cultural groups who were not directly connected to the
    Irish diaspora.Periodical Famines reveals how, within the transatlantic
    Irish periodical market between 1845 and 1910, Irish, Irish American, and
    Irish Canadian newspapers and magazines acted as carriers and shapers of
    cultural identities. Lindsay Janssen argues that famine memory was deployed
    transhistorically to help represent other crucial events in the Irish past,
    and periodicals used Famine recollections transnationally to give new
    meaning to events outside of Ireland, such as labor issues in the United
    States and the Second Boer War. Moving beyond individual writings to
    interrogate how different texts printed within a periodical issue influenced
    each other and affected audiences' attitudes to Irish hunger and distress,
    Janssen's cotextual approach reveals the intricate and sometimes divergent
    paths that Famine memory traveled through in the decades during and after
    its onset.Drawing upon a substantial corpus of creative and nonfiction
    periodical publications (including nearly 600 works of poetry and prose
    fiction), Periodical Famines is a thorough analysis of transatlantic Irish
    periodical culture during and after the Great Famine, demonstrating how
    periodicals' transmission of famine memories shaped global cultures.

  abstract: >-
    In the decade before the Great Famine, Ireland experienced a boom in
    microfinance institutions (MFIs). Taking a social enterprise perspective,
    this paper analyses the institutional context for this boom. It finds
    ­evidence linking the boom in MFIs to the development, via the introduction
    of the poor law in 1838, of a nascent welfare state at the end of a very
    turbulent period in Irish history. Many contemporary writers saw
    microfinance as a legal means that could lessen the burden on rate payers by
    helping the poor help themselves. Econometric analysis at Poor Law Union
    level confirms the link between MFIs, an Irish solution, and the poor law, a
    British solution, to Ireland’s chronic poverty. The goal of the Irish
    solution was to address what was perceived to be the cause of poverty, a
    want of capital, while the British solution addressed the symptoms of
    poverty but not its root cause.

    This article considers the encounter between Irish and Indian advanced
    nationalists through the prism of a group of university students who came
    from India to Ireland to study law between 1913 and 1916. Before considering
    their interaction with Irish politics and the inspiration they drew from it,
    it explores the possible push and pull factors that may have drawn
    nationally minded Indian law students to come to Ireland in the years before
    1913. It establishes for the first time the administrative and political
    reasons why Dublin became an attractive city for some Indians who wished to
    study law in Ireland rather than England. Exploring the life of Indian law
    students in Dublin in the years before the Easter Rising of 1916, the
    article focuses on V. V. Giri, at the time just one of the small groups of
    Dublin’s Indian law students studying between the King’s Inns and University
    College Dublin. Giri later became the fourth president of India, but his
    prominence here is that he left a memoir of his time in Ireland. The memoir
    allows for an exploration of a history that is otherwise largely forgotten
    and of which only the slightest traces remain in Irish and British archival
    sources, making this as much a study of the process of historical
    reconstruction as it is of its subjects.

  abstract: >-
    'I found it fascinating - it's an integral part of the history of Dublin
    that has been lost to time for too long' - Rick O'SheaA feminist history of
    Europe's largest red-light district and an examination of the lives of the
    women who worked there.Tucked away in Dublin's north inner city, Monto -
    purported to be Europe's biggest red-light district from 1860 to 1925 with
    up to 1600 sex workers at any one time - made headlines for wild tales of
    debauchery. However, what happened to the women and girls within its
    brothels in life and death is less clear.This account balances the
    historical origins of Monto's rise and fall with an investigation into the
    inhumane and heartbreaking reality of the treatment of the women that worked
    there, while delving into the impact of class, sexual violence and British
    colonialism on the women's survival. West explores the stigma and violence
    the women and girls of Monto endured, and investigates the shocking claims
    surrounding their treatment by medial professionals.Weaving together oral
    histories, historical records, fashion trends and family memories, this book
    brings the women of Monto to life within its pages as it explores how they
    lived, worked, loved, dressed, mourned and built a tight-knit community.
