    Media technology today connects potential donors to sufferers of
    humanitarian crises across the globe. Like most other phenomena, this form
    of international philanthropy has a rich history. In Aiding Ireland: The
    Great Famine and the Rise of Transnational Philanthropy, Anelise Hanson
    Shrout contributes to the Irish famine’s deep historiography by portraying
    the famine as one of the first truly global humanitarian relief efforts (3).
    This fine intellectual study provides an alternative explanation for the
    complex motivations behind disparate groups’ charitable support of starving
    Irish families.

    "Killester: from medieval manor to garden suburb" explores the development
    of Killester from its earliest days as Killester Demense, through its
    transformation in the early twentieth century as a garden suburb for
    ex-servicemen and onwards to the emergence of today's suburb. Its history
    has given it a unique character and this is richly illustrated by maps and
    photographs. This is the first of a series of studies, entitled Dublin -
    Shaping the Suburbs, that explores the development of Dublin's suburbs as
    many reach their centenary. This publication was commissioned by Dublin City
    Council as part of the Dublin City Strategic Heritage Plan 2023 to 2028, and
    is part funded by the Heritage Council.

  abstract: >-
    Using extensive and fresh archival material, this book places the
    relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland after 1921 in a new
    light, encouraging us to rethink the dominant narrative of conflict and
    strife. While the work does not shy away from the clear points of dispute,
    it contends that these were far from the full story.Clearly, partition and
    the Troubles seen from the late 1960s onwards cast a long shadow, but
    disputes over Northern Ireland must be placed alongside those successes seen
    elsewhere. Unpacking a variety of topics including trade, tourism, the
    treatment of tuberculosis, and migration, this work covers new ground in
    social and political history. It balances an analysis of high politics –
    Cosgrave and de Valera on the one side and Baldwin and Attlee on the other –
    with the actions of ordinary people – nurses, doctors, sports fans, and
    labourers. The British–Irish story is also placed in a wider context through
    comparison with both countries’ dealings with America and an outline of
    their coordinated entry into the European Economic Community.This study will
    be an ideal resource to both students and all those wishing to consider and
    re-examine the fate of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the British Empire.

    "The Oxford History of the Irish Book, Volume II: The Printed Book in Irish,
    1567-2010s is the second volume in Oxford's signature, five-volume History
    of the Irish Book series. With eighty-two chapters by seventy leading
    commentators on, and participants in, Irish book history, this volume spans
    almost five hundred years of Irish-language book printing, production,
    publication, distribution, and reception. It begins with the 1567
    publication of John Carswell's Gaelic version of the Book of Common Order
    and follows the story of the printed book (and journalism) in Irish into the
    twenty-first century, the internet, ebooks, and other formats. This volume
    covers religious publications from the sixteenth to eighteenth century,
    competing versions of Irish history, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century
    texts which reflected an 'antiquarian' interest in Ireland and its culture,
    ongoing literary production in the nineteenth century, printers, publishers,
    literacy, books and volumes produced by learned societies interested in
    Irish language and culture, Gaelic Revival publications, post-Independence
    literature and its publishers, journalism from the late eighteenth to
    twenty-first century, lexicography, nonfiction, educational publishing,
    folklore and place lore, translation, the contribution of scholars from
    outside Ireland, publishing in the Irish diaspora, typography, book design
    and illustration, the reception of Irish-language texts (from censorship to
    bestseller status), book collection, and, finally, sources for the study of
    Irish book history"--

    Using newspaper coverage of women's and girl's property offences in minor
    English and Irish courts, I analyze courts’ use of Catholic convent
    institutions between 1930 and 1959. Coverage of minor local hearings offers
    access to everyday cases, where boundaries between moral and legal
    transgression were blurred. I explore three interlocking themes in newspaper
    reports. First, those courts sent to convents were punished, at least in
    part, for breaching prevailing gendered moral norms. Second, judges
    represented convents as sites of moral reform; justifying convent detention
    by reinforcing gendered notions of damaged female agency. Finally, judges
    sent women and girls to convents even when they publicly resisted. In these
    ways, courts reinforced reliance on convents for gendered “moral
    reclamation.” In the conclusion, I explore the argument's implications for
    state reckoning with historical abuses in institutions like Ireland's
    Magdalene laundries, showing how abolition feminist legal histories can pose
    new questions about relationships between law and the experience of mass
    incarceration.

    On a balmy July evening in 1972, soundtracked by The Dubliners, Muhammad Ali
    climbed through the ropes to fight Al ‘Blue’ Lewis at Croke Park. The most
    famous athlete in the world had somehow been inveigled to Ireland by Butty
    Sugrue, a former circus strongman turned charismatic entrepreneur. He was
    ridiculed for trying to do the impossible right up to the moment Ali and his
    entourage touched down at Dublin Airport. So began a magical week of the
    most glorious mayhem, as ‘the Champ’ charmed the Irish people.Ali could be
    found jogging along Wicklow lanes, strolling into The Old Stand pub,
    chatting with street cleaners, and paying an early morning visit to the GPO
    to receive a history lesson about the Easter Rising. No matter where he
    fetched up, wonderful chaos ensued. Traffic stopped. Crowds gathered. The
    greatest show on earth had come to town.Through interviews with dozens of
    those Ali met and worked with over the course of those unforgettable days,
    Dave Hannigan has pieced together an enthralling narrative of one of the
    most unique events in Irish sporting history.

    This article examines how the Catholic Church, working hand in glove with
    the Irish State, used the education system in order to regulate Irish
    sexuality in the early decades of Irish independence. Through an analysis of
    a range of primary sources, interwoven with oral testimony, it argues that
    the dominance exercised by the Catholic Church in the organisational culture
    of schools, its control over the training of teachers and its suppression of
    a sex education curriculum, all contributed significantly to the regulation
    of sexuality in the period under review.

  abstract: >-
    Ireland has long been the focus of research into its geological foundations
    and history. This book provides insights into the evolution of geological
    ideas in Ireland, gives assessments of underrepresented scientists, and
    offers an appreciation of the value of geological collections for historical
    research.

    Through a series of twenty-two papers, this volume provides syntheses and
    analyses of aspects of this geological research and places the role of a
    number of individuals firmly within context. The topics discussed include
    the considerations of the nature of igneous rocks, aspects of geological
    mapping of the country, the role played by Irish scientists in determining
    the age of the Earth, and the importance of early mineralogical and
    geological collectors and the role their collections made to advancing
    geological knowledge both in Ireland and Europe.

    The Making of Irish Geology 1740–1940 will appeal to both the general and
    academic reader interested in the development of the geological sciences,
    with a particular focus on Ireland.

  abstract: >-
    How migrants navigate their sense of home between the place left behind and
    the new place of destination is a crucial question. The social scientific
    perspective has increasingly come to emphasize the multiplicity of home and
    appreciates that home provides a bridge between “here” and “there.” In this
    article we explore how notions of home compare between migrants who arrived
    in the US throughout the 19th and 20th century. We can draw on a uniquely
    rich comparative set of letters written by people who left German-speaking
    Europe or Ireland. Our analysis of more than 12,000 letters uses methods of
    linguistic analysis to navigate between a macro-perspective, focused on term
    frequencies, a meso-perspective focused on the contextual meaning of the
    terms home and Heimat, and a micro-perspective providing in-depth details of
    two sets of letter collections. We find that the emotional words used to
    express an affective link with home reveal a deeper process of
    socio-cultural integration among the two groups. Indeed, we find that home
    is being talked about a lot more frequently in the Irish compared to the
    German letters, pointing to a profound divergence in the integration
    process. In the German letters, America quickly became home, which occurred
    at a much slower rate among the Irish. Moreover, the Irish maintained a
    desire to return home to Ireland for longer, an idea that the German writers
    contemplated only rarely.

  abstract: "Until now, in-depth analysis of key female figures in Irish republicanism in the early twentieth century has been limited. Mary MacSwiney was one of the most single-minded anti-Treaty women, leading Eamon de Valera to describe her as ‘incorrigible’. Rather than just dismiss MacSwiney as one-dimensional in her opposition to the Treaty and in her continued political intractability, this biography seeks to place her political life within the centre of the turn of the twentieth-century republican narrative and understand why she was increasingly viewed as a virago. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ To say contemporary gender roles played a part in reducing MacSwiney to a cipher for extreme republicanism limits a fuller understanding of her political life. Her uncompromising stance against the evils of compromise during the Treaty negotiations was indelibly formed by the experience of watching her brother Terence MacSwiney die on hunger strike in Brixton Jail in 1920, and the trauma she experienced. She witnessed an intimate act of self-sacrifice which bound her to a belief that her task was to continue her brother’s fidelity to a separatist republic. Betrayal of the republic, for her, would meant betrayal of a brother she loved and admired. Mary MacSwiney situates this standout figure in the context of her tightly knit family, tracing her political evolution from suffrage and cultural revival activism to advanced nationalism. While the focus of MacSwiney’s political action was Cork, from 1920 onwards she began to assume a progressively more important role in Irish politics at a national and international level, including American tours, a central role during the Civil War and within Sinn Féin and a close political relationship with de Valera. From 1926 onward, she was increasingly politically isolated and marginalised as she sparred with members of Fianna Fáil in the press, seeking to justify her continued refusal to engage with the reality of the Irish Free State. Leading biographer of women in twentieth-century Irish history, Leeann Lane delves into newly discovered archival material to interrogate MacSwiney’s oppositional stance to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. Mary MacSwiney offers a comprehensive understanding of a misrepresented and marginalised voice in early twentieth-century Irish politics."

  abstract: >-
    From the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, showbands were all the rage among
    Ireland's dancing audiences. Performing covers of rock 'n' roll and pop hits
    from American and British weekly Top 10 charts, they riveted their fans,
    dismayed many parish priests, and offered Irish youth a taste of modernism
    and pop culture from outside of Ireland.In Are You Dancing?, Rebecca S.
    Miller tells the story of how these working-class bands brought new sounds
    and choreographies to the Irish and Northern Irish pop landscape. Both as a
    response to and an agent in Ireland's changing economic landscape, showbands
    quickly grew into a hugely lucrative commercial industry. At the same time,
    they nudged open doors for Irish women to take to the stage as pop stars,
    rewarded a generation of entrepreneurs, and created the template for
    Ireland's popular music industry. Miller draws upon interviews with more
    than 80 musicians, agents, managers, fans, and clergy, to reveal the vast
    interplay of social, economic, and cultural changes that ensued with the
    Irish showband era.Drawing upon an extensive catalog of ethnographic and
    archival research, Miller presents an overlooked era of musical performances
    that revolutionized Irish entertainment.

  abstract: >-
    The general public, both within Ireland and further abroad, has begun to
    take an interest in Irish lifting stones. A simple premise, lifting stones
    are historically significant stones which were typically lifted as tests of
    manhood within rural and fishing communities in Ireland. It is an Irish
    practice with global parallels in Europe and Asia. The popular history of
    this endeavour is currently being written with claims that this practice,
    once popular, was wiped out during the Great Famine. This article marks the
    first academic study of lifting stones in Ireland. It situates them in a
    domestic and global context, discusses the sources one can use in studying
    the topic and uses a combination of folklore, anthropology and fiction to
    evaluate known written sources on the topic. More importantly it highlights
    the multifaceted and gendered histories which can be told through this
    topic. The article thus seeks to do three things: first to raise awareness
    of the public histories being written on this topic, second to implore a
    more rigid groundwork for studying this practice and third to stress the
    value such an area has in the growing field of masculinity studies in
    Ireland.

  abstract: >-
    Even as members of the social elite participated in the European Grand Tour,
    travellers, writers, and readers increasingly recognized that Britain and
    Ireland might offer sights and experiences to rival the continent. This
    collection examines the practice and representation of tourism on 'home'
    ground during the period when modern Britain was invented and became a
    powerful and prosperous imperial nation. Interdisciplinary essays explore
    the diverse variety of tours and tourist agendas – artistic, industrial,
    leisure, scientific – and they address the ways in which travellers'
    'discovery' of Britain and Ireland was an active and often self-critical
    process that potentially encompassed encounters with the alien and
    unfamiliar. Considering travellers from the wider world as well as from
    within Britain and Ireland, contributors discuss the function of comparative
    reference in contemporary travel-writing, as tourists often thought with and
    through others as they reflected on the distinctiveness and significance of
    the sites that they visited.

    In this revealing memoir – which remained unpublished for almost 50 years –
    Dan Mulvihill, a leading figure in Irish republicanism recounts the fight
    for Irish independence over the course of several decades and his central
    involvement in key events throughout the twentieth century.Dan Mulvihill was
    a leading Irish republican who was at the centre of many of the most iconic
    and tumultuous events during Ireland’s revolutionary years. He was an IRA
    volunteer who fought and killed in the name of Ireland, a loyal ally of
    Éamon de Valera – who he smuggled out of Dublin at the beginning of the
    Civil War – a vehement opponent of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, a member of Liam
    Lynch’s staff in the anti-Treaty IRA, a prisoner and hunger striker, a spy
    and intelligence officer.In One Man’s Ireland, Mulvihill details his life
    story from 1916 to the early 1980s, describing the seminal events in the
    history of the country as well as the many key figures in republicanism in
    his native Kerry and nationally. A self-styled maverick and committed
    revolutionary, Dan Mulvihill was a largely forgotten figure in Irish
    history, until now.

  abstract: >-
    In the 1800s, as Britain became the world's most powerful industrial empire,
    Ireland starved. The Great Famine fractured long-held assumptions about
    political economy and 'civilisation', threatening disorder in Britain.
    Ireland was a laboratory for empire, shaping British ideas about
    colonisation, population, ecology and work.In Rot, Padraic Scanlan
    reinterprets the history of this time and the result is a revelatory account
    of Ireland's Great Famine. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
    nowhere in Europe - or the world - did the working poor depend as completely
    on potatoes as in Ireland. To many British observers, potatoes were evidence
    of a lack of modernity among the Irish. However, Ireland before the famine
    more closely resembled capitalism's future than its past. While poverty
    before and during the Great Famine was often blamed on Irish backwardness,
    it did in fact stem from the British Empire's embrace of modern capitalism.
    Uncovering the disaster's roots in Britain's deep imperial faith in markets
    and capitalism, Rot reshapes our understanding of the Famine and its tragic
    legacy.'Richly underpinned by research in contemporary sources and firmly
    rooted in historical scholarship.' Fintan O'Toole'Rot is a moving modern
    history of the Great Potato Famine. With great insight and impeccable
    research, Padraic Scanlan vividly brings this terrible catastrophe and the
    stories of its heroes and villains back to life. Tyler Anbinder, author of
    City of Dreams'Rot brilliantly blends economic, social, and environmental
    history to deliver a stunning new account of one of nineteenth-century
    Europe's most shameful tragedies. Padraic Scanlan joins clear-eyed,
    comprehensive research and analysis to deliver a persuasive indictment of
    faith in free markets. As illuminating as it is harrowing, Rot is a
    must-read for anybody interested in the histories of capitalism and empire.'
    Maya Jasanoff, author of The Dawn Watch'Crisply written and based on an
    impressive range of contemporary sources, Padraic Scanlan's Rot is the best
    kind of historical writing.' Sean Connolly, author of On Every Tide'Rot is a
    book I have longed to read. Framing the Irish Famine within the context of
    the British empire is revelatory. An incredibly important work.' Sathnam
    Sanghera, author of Empireworld

  abstract: >-
    Aiding Ireland is a brisk, readable book on an important subject. Anelise
    Hanson Shrout aims to explain “the emergence of ideas about international
    obligations in the face of disaster” in the 1840s (2). The disaster that she
    refers to is, of course, the Irish Famine, which prompted, as she puts it,
    “one of the first truly global humanitarian relief efforts” (3). Over eight
    chapters she charts how those relief efforts drew on interpretations of the
    famine that sometimes had very little to do with its victims and rather more
    to do with donors’ own immediate material and ideological concerns. Each
    chapter takes us a little further from Ireland. The final chapter
    intriguingly (and sensitively) probes donations offered by Indigenous
    Americans, acts which have been commemorated in Ireland in recent years.
    Along the way Shrout takes in debates about free trade; imperial obligation;
    US expansionism; transatlantic land reform; and the contest over enslavement
    in the US South.

  abstract: >-
    A new history of the Celts that reveals how this once-forgotten people
    became a pillar of modern national identity in Britain, Ireland, and
    FranceBefore the Greeks and Romans, the Celts ruled the ancient world. They
    sacked Rome, invaded Greece, and conquered much of Europe, from Ireland to
    Turkey. Celts registered deeply on the classical imagination for a thousand
    years and were variously described by writers like Caesar and Livy as unruly
    barbarians, fearless warriors, and gracious hosts. But then, in the early
    Middle Ages, they vanished. In The Celts, Ian Stewart tells the story of
    their rediscovery during the Renaissance and their transformation over the
    next few centuries into one of the most popular European ancestral
    peoples.The Celts shows how the idea of this ancient people was recovered by
    scholars, honed by intellectuals, politicians, and other thinkers of various
    stripes, and adopted by cultural revivalists and activists as they tried to
    build European nations and nationalisms during the eighteenth and nineteenth
    centuries. Long-forgotten, the Celts improbably came to be seen as the
    ancestors of most western Europeans—and as a pillar of modern national
    identity in Britain, Ireland, and France.Based on new research conducted
    across Europe and in the United States, The Celts reveals when and how we
    came to call much of Europe “Celtic,” why this idea mattered in the past,
    and why it still matters today, as the tide of nationalism is once again on
    the rise.

    The Amity Papers, 1690 reproduces 74 documents seized from the Irish vessel
    Amity trading with France at the height of the Williamite War (1689-1691).
    Mostly letters written by merchants (with a smaller number penned by
    Jacobite soldiers), the ship's papers illustrate particularly the plight of
    civilians during the 1690 siege of Limerick, which ended just weeks before
    the Amity sailed. The writers and their correspondents–mostly living in
    France–were part of two mercantile networks, one Catholic and the other
    Quaker. The collaboration between the two enabled Franco-Irish trade to
    continue despite wartime challenges. The letters also illuminate the
    economic consequences of wartime conditions in Ireland: requisitioning, the
    forced circulation of rapidly depreciating brass money, and the risks of
    buying or selling goods in this context.
