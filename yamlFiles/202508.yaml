    The following communication sets a previously unrecorded manuscript by John
    Locke in context. The manuscript comprises his remarks on a bill to create a
    ‘Flax and Hemp Company of Ireland’, laid before the Irish House of Commons
    in November 1695, which circulated in London in late 1697. Locke likely made
    his remarks for the lord chancellor, Sir John Somers, among whose papers
    they survive. The manuscript sheds new light on Locke’s practical
    involvement in post-revolutionary political economy, on his engagement with
    Ireland, and on his thought regarding corporations and corporate corruption.

    This volume presents a rich variety of new scholarly explorations of life in
    medieval Dublin, including an analysis by Bruce Campbell of the occupational
    profile of medieval Dubliners as revealed by records such as the famous
    Guild Merchant Roll; we also present Valentin Rothaupt's analytical
    comparison of the spectrum of occupations and the influence of guilds in
    Dublin with those of Gaffeln in the German city of Cologne; Peter Crooks
    calls attention to the huge collection of Latin deeds surviving from the
    medieval city and their enormous historical value, while Sarah Hendriks
    discusses the records of Dublin's late medieval guild of carpenters. The
    book also contains an examination by Patrick Wadden of Richard Stanihurst's
    famous claim that Oxmantown began life in the year 1095 following an
    invasion of Dublin by ' Easterlings'; Caitlin Ellis explores links between
    Dublin and the medieval earldom of Orkney in the era of the battle of
    Clontarf; Denis Casey offers a critical re-examination of the story of the
    elaborate feast held at Dublin by King Henry II at Christmas 1171; Shea
    Brennan discusses the famous triennial ceremonial procession through the
    suburbs of the city, known as the ' Riding of the Franchises'; while the
    volume also hosts Bernadette Williams's evaluation of how the Dublin
    chronicler John de Pembridge chose to portray contemporary English kings and
    their lieutenants in Ireland. Major archaeological excavations have been
    conducted by Edmond O' Donovan at the site of the great St Mary's Cistercian
    Abbey and this volume contains his preliminary report, along with the
    results of Paul Duffy's dig nearby at the abbey's ' Cemetary Gate' and outer
    precinct wall. Franc Myles also presents results from his excavation at
    Keysars Lane beside St Audoen' s; Caitrí ona Moore discusses her excavation
    of a riverfront site at Strand Street Great and Abbey Street Upper; while
    Muireann Ní Cheallachá in describes the contents of a medieval dumping
    ground she found at Chancery Street in Oxmantown. Artefactual studies
    include John Nicholl's report on an important assemblage of shoes and other
    leatherwork dating from the late tenth century onwards, excavated at Strand
    Street Great.

    The literatures of medieval Wales and Ireland are among the richest
    vernacular traditions of medieval Europe. From a large corpus of poetry and
    prose, key texts such as the Welsh Mabinogion, the Irish sagas, Celtic Latin
    literature, chronicles, saints’ lives and court poetry have established
    their place within the written legacy of medieval Europe. This collection of
    original essays by leading Celtic scholars, writing in honour of Catherine
    McKenna, Professor of Celtic at Harvard University, goes beyond the familiar
    canon of medieval Celtic literatures to showcase a wide range of Welsh and
    Irish texts that are compelling in their literary imagination and technical
    innovation.

  abstract: >-
    The year 1800 is best known in Irish and British history for the passage of
    the Act of Union, a constitutional change that bound Ireland and Britain
    together under the one parliament. Yet the common people had more urgent
    matters on their mind. ‘Mobs’ took to the streets of Dublin, not to protest
    at the abolition of the Irish parliament in College Green but to protest the
    hunger that afflicted their stomachs. Similar protests took place in other
    places, from Clonakilty in west Cork, Killaloe on the Shannon to Drogheda on
    the east coast. The years 1799 and 1800 witnessed poor harvests, with
    soaring food prices and widespread distress in 1800 and 1801 in both Ireland
    and Britain. The rise in potato prices relative to its pre-crisis level was
    as great in 1799–1801 as in the worst years of the Great Famine a half
    century later. Indeed the prices of potatoes and oatmeal, the principal
    means of subsistence for the poorer classes in Ireland, rose more in
    1799-1801 than at any time between the mid-eighteenth century and the First
    World War. Yet the surprising fact is that Irish society somehow
    side-stepped a full-blown famine. How and why this happened are the subject
    of this paper.

  abstract: >-
    In the autumn of 1835, as the Orange Order faced a parliamentary inquiry and
    the imminent prospect of being banned, an 'Old Orangeman', signing himself
    'Montanus', wrote a series of articles defending the Orange brethren and
    telling their story. Almost forgotten since first publication, these
    articles together form a unique and intelligent view from inside the Order
    in its first cycle. Montanus discusses the Orangemen's self-organisation by
    the Protestant peasantry of County Armagh in 1795, their struggle against
    the United Irishmen, dissensions over the Act of Union, feuding with the
    Catholic nationalist Ribbon Society, extraordinary influence on the
    government of Ireland and their last-ditch opposition to Daniel O'Connell's
    campaign for Catholic Emancipation.Old Orangeman was a product of
    eighteenth-century Enlightened thought and became an eloquent warning voice
    against the perils of toleration and liberalism. He had been associated with
    the Order from its birth. He knew both its leading men and their deadly
    enemies, including Theobald Wolfe Tone. Most striking, perhaps, is Old
    Orangeman's carefully argued justification of the Order as a timely and
    irreplaceable bulwark against the rising tide of democracy and
    radicalism.These 'Letters from an Old Orangeman' are not just a personal
    memoir or a one-sided history, but a carefully argued political treatise on
    the necessity of mobilising and organising the 'reactionary democracy' in an
    age of popular politics. Their republication now is an important
    contribution not only to the history of sectarian discord in Ulster and
    Ireland. It supplies an important source for the study of popular
    conservatism and the psychology of counter-revolution in the United Kingdom
    and beyond.Montanus feared that he, who had 'rocked the cradle' of the
    Institution, might now be fated to 'follow its hearse'. His letters instead
    provide an unrivalled insight into one of Ireland's most tenacious and
    consequential survivals.

    Through an examination of four newspapers of the nineteenth-century Irish
    press at home and abroad, this essay investigates the depiction of women
    within the dichotomy of the archetypes of proper women, who conformed to
    Victorian ideas of femininity, and reprobate woman, who did not. It argues
    that each paper characterized the ideal and reprobate woman based upon their
    overall ideology. All papers ascribed to traditional Victorian notions of
    femininity, regardless of their stance on nationalism or other issues, but
    the particulars differed.

  abstract: >-
    This article seeks both to reassess the dynamics of the Northern Irish civil
    rights movement during the mid to late 1960s, as well as to suggest a new
    understanding of the role of parliamentary forces in furthering the goals of
    social movements. During the 1960s, Northern Ireland underwent significant
    socio-political upheaval, centred on the rights of the region’s Catholic
    minority and their long-term concerns regarding democratic representation,
    unemployment and housing. The resulting civil rights movement sought to
    avoid the traditional ethno-nationalist fault lines of Ulster politics and
    appealed directly to the British government and people, bypassing the
    devolved Stormont parliament with its permanent Protestant-Unionist
    majority. While vital work has been done to analyse this important period,
    aspects of British-based activism for civil rights in Northern Ireland have
    not yet been fully scrutinised. One key British group was the Campaign for
    Democracy in Ulster (CDU). Primarily made up of backbench Labour MPs, the
    CDU pursued civil rights at Westminster by advocating for governmental
    inquiries and legislative reform to address Catholic grievances. Although
    highly energetic, the CDU faced deep constitutional barriers and the
    organisation’s efforts have generally been seen as unsuccessful. However,
    new archival work and a reappraisal of previous studies suggests a more
    nuanced view. The CDU had more influence than the organisation itself
    believed. This has implications not only for our understanding of the civil
    rights movement, but also for interpreting the actions of groups such as the
    CDU, described here as ‘Parliamentary Activists’, both historically and in
    the present day.
