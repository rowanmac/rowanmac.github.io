    Kilwaughter – The Unknown Castle: Four Centuries of Power, Politics, and
    DeclineOn the edge of Larne in County Antrim, the crumbling remains of
    Kilwaughter Castle whisper of a forgotten past. Once a proud plantation
    house, it has borne silent witness to centuries of conquest, ambition,
    scandal, and resilience.From the ancient Ó Gnímh bards—later Anglicised to
    Agnew—through Anglo-Norman lords, Scottish settlers, and Italian
    aristocrats, this richly researched narrative traces the turbulent journey
    of a single estate and the extraordinary lives entwined with it. Meet
    figures who helped shape Belfast, men embroiled in politics and rebellion,
    profiteers of the West Indies slave trade, and a determined American woman
    who sought to rescue the castle from oblivion.Through war, abandonment, and
    faded glory, Kilwaughter – The Unknown Castle brings to life the rise and
    fall of families, the clash of empires, and the enduring legacy of a
    remarkable structure. For readers of historical biography, social history,
    and architectural heritage, this is a vivid portrait of one forgotten corner
    of Northern Ireland—and the global currents that shaped it.

    For generations the Irish farm has been a way of life, anchoring
    communities, shaping traditions and instilling values passed down through
    the furrows of time. Rooted in fertile soil and a favourable climate,
    Ireland’s farming heritage runs deep, tied to the rhythm of the seasons and
    the enduring bond between farmers and the land.In this richly illustrated
    book, the bestselling duo of Michael B. Barry and John O’Byrne bring the
    story of the Irish farm vividly to life, from the late nineteenth century to
    the close of the twentieth. Through over 200 colourised photographs, the
    book captures the hardship and the humour, and the toil and the togetherness
    of life on the land.A heartfelt celebration of the Irish countryside and
    those who shaped it is a tribute to the fields, the families and the fierce
    resilience at the heart of rural Ireland.

    An I.R.B. supreme council member and the I.R.A. 2nd Northern Division
    commandant, Charlie Daly was executed at Drumboe on 14 March 1923. Daly’s
    case shows how, through I.R.B. auspices, Free State G.H.Q. planned a joint
    northern offensive with republicans to avert civil war, while deploying the
    resources of the new state (and false promises) to engineer the support or
    at least neutrality of the Northern I.R.A. Eoin O’Duffy and Richard Mulcahy
    connived to remove Daly from his command because of his opposition to the
    Treaty, with events coming to a head at the ‘Beggar’s Bush inquiry’ on 2
    March 1922. In due course, the Free State elite killed every senior
    republican brother party to the northern intrigue, including Joe McKelvey
    and Daly, the latter of whom was shot alongside Seán Larkin from Derry — a
    witness to GHQ ‘crookedness’ the previous March.

    This paper provides for the first time a description and interpretation of
    the metal shoe commonly referred to as the shrine of St Brigid’s shoe.
    Associated with Loughrea, Co. Galway, the shoe was acquired by George Petrie
    before 1845 and is now held as part of the Royal Irish Academy collection by
    the National Museum of Ireland. Four key findings are presented. First, that
    the date inscribed on the shoe, ostensibly 1410, is in fact 1710 and refers
    to the year of its manufacture. Second, that the shoe is unlikely to have
    been a reliquary but was a surrogate in devotional terms. Third, that the
    shoe is specifically derivative of a seventeenth-century shoe-shaped
    reliquary preserved at Asti in northern Italy. Fourth, that an inscription
    on the shoe carries a political message in defiance of contemporary
    legislation. The shoe is discussed throughout with reference to the medieval
    cult of St Brigid and to wider Irish tradition.

    Intellectual Disability and Ireland, 1947–1996: Towards a Full Life? by
    David Kilgannon draws from his PhD thesis, sponsored by a Wellcome Trust
    Doctoral Studentship. Kilgannon’s research is warmly welcomed, as the
    history of disabled people in Ireland remains mostly untrodden. This work
    plots the evolution of statutory disability policy. At the beginning of the
    period, there was a focus on the protection and segregation of
    intellectually disabled people. By the period’s end, the approach had
    changed to caring within the community and striving for a ‘normal’
    life.Kilgannon’s work is meticulously and skilfully researched using a rich
    range of sources and archives, including the archives of Lenus, University
    College Dublin, Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Dublin Diocesan, RTÉ
    and Royal Physicians of Ireland. Additional records utilised by Kilgannon
    came from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland organisational records,
    patient registers from St John’s Hospital and St Columba’s Psychiatric
    Hospital, as well as records from the Department of Finance.

  abstract: >-
    A provocative and original reinterpretation of modern Irish history.There is
    a widespread misconception that Ireland became 'modern' much later than its
    neighbours, in the 1960s and 1970s. This is grounded in several enduring
    stereotypes and caricatures: of Ireland as a 'timeless' and unchanging 'land
    of saints and scholars'; of its society and culture in the long nineteenth
    century as puritanical, regressive, or archaic; of Gaelic language and
    culture as 'backward' or inward-looking in contrast to a 'modern' English
    counterpart; and of the island as natural and rural in the face of the urban
    and technological 'progress' of modernity.Drawing on an extensive range of
    sources, from poetry and novels to contemporary historical documents,
    acclaimed historian Enda Delaney here offers a reinterpretation of Ireland's
    encounter with modernity that corrects these stereotypes. By situating the
    island's history between 1780 and 1916 within its broader European, global,
    and colonial contexts, he demonstrates that Ireland's pathway to modernity
    was not inevitable, belated, or uni-directional: over a complex and
    centuries-long process it was made modern, and in its own distinctive way.
    This was related to, but distinct from, Ireland's complicated colonial
    relationship with Britain, and played out in the broader contexts of
    globalisation and the rise of capitalism. And at the heart of this history
    are the Irish people themselves, both those who lived on the island and the
    millions of those who left during this period and made their lives in
    Britain, America, Australia, and beyond, who made sense of modernity in a
    variety of conflicting ways and, in so doing, sought to shape their own
    destinies and adapt the 'old' ways of doing things in the face of relentless
    waves of 'progress'. Changes in values, consciousness, and beliefs
    interacted with broader social, political, and cultural revolutions to
    create a distinctive experience of becoming modern.The result is a bold and
    wide-ranging new history of modern Ireland that restores agency to those who
    lived and made its history, raising important and timely questions about
    modernity, globalisation, modern history, and post-colonialism.

    'Here is a history of publand, yes, but here is a moment in time as
    well.'For centuries, the public house has played an important role in the
    social and cultural history of Dublin. As the headquarters for a major
    revolution, a mecca of literary invention or a haven from work, ‘the local’
    is a cornerstone of community life and a testament to human endeavour in an
    ever-changing city.Beginning with the taverns and ale houses of the 17th and
    18th centuries, Donal Fallon brings the reader on a visual journey through
    world renowned public houses such as the Brazen Head, The Long Hall,
    Grogan’s and The Palace, and on to early houses and gay bars, spirit grocers
    and shebeens. As well as the establishments themselves, the ‘Plain People of
    Ireland’ appear in chapters about temperance, karaoke and snugs. Along the
    way, we meet patrons as diverse and famous around the capital as Theobald
    Wolfe Tone, Nell McCafferty and Con Houlihan. And visitors to Dublin are
    also here, as the photographer Lee Miller seeks out the city of James Joyce
    and Elizabeth Taylor searches in vain for the Ladies’ toilet.Drawing from
    rich archival collections, The Dublin Pub includes many previously
    unpublished photographs as well as testimonies from the past and present to
    bring the history of the Dublin pub to vivid life.

    This article demonstrates how the Women’s International League (WIL) dealt
    with the changing ideas of nationhood, internationalism, imperialism, and
    freedom when supporting the cause of Irish independence. Their actions
    included seeking to protect Britain’s good name while simultaneously
    criticising that very same nation for its war in Ireland. The ‘small
    nations’ rhetoric that had emerged during the First World War was used by
    British feminists to divorce the atrocities of the British Crown force, the
    Black and Tans, from the wider colonial experience of oppression. Comparing
    the occupation of Ireland in 1919–1921 to that of Belgium during the First
    World War enabled British internationalist-feminists to support the
    sovereignty of Ireland’s nationhood, without necessarily having to engage
    with the colonial dimension or history of the conflict. This entirely
    changed the parameters within which British feminists could show solidarity
    with the Irish republicans while still maintaining positive views of British
    imperialism and the empire.

    Following the career of the Irish lace designer and inspector Emily Anderson
    (1856-1948), this book traces a network of designers, makers, organizations
    and institutions involved in the late-19th and early-20th-century Irish lace
    industry and explores their contemporary relevance. Molly-Claire Gillett
    maps the Irish lace industry’s connection to stakeholders such as the
    British Department of Science and Art, the Cork School of Art, The Irish
    Agricultural Organisation Society and the Irish Department of Agriculture
    and Technical Instruction, pairing a close study of patterns and techniques
    with an investigation of broader issues in design education, philanthropy
    and women’s professionalization. Concluding with a consideration of
    contemporary Irish lacemaking – now proudly claimed as an element of
    Ireland’s intangible cultural heritage – Gillett tells the story of a
    20th-century shift in the conception of lace design as ‘art for industry’,
    and lacemaking as an economic necessity to both practices as expressions of
    identity, creativity and community-building. Richly illustrated and framed
    within the narrative of Anderson’s life and career as a woman designer and
    civil servant during a pivotal moment in Irish history, Irish Lacemaking is
    an essential resource for students and researchers in craft, women’s history
    and Irish Studies.

    Detailed legal and court records of household and personal violence do not
    survive from early modern Ireland in sufficient numbers to allow for
    statistical analysis. However, close reading of selected court narratives
    about violence between householders allows analysis of the contested
    contemporary meanings of violence. In their descriptions, witnesses read the
    marks on injured bodies and interpreted their meanings according to gendered
    hierarchies of power within households. This article uses such narratives to
    analyse interpersonal violence between members of families and households in
    early modern Ireland.

    This article examines Conor Cruise O’Brien’s ideas about historical
    objectivity and the craft of the historian. Drawing on a mix of published
    material and unpublished manuscript sources, it charts the evolution of the
    thinking of a key Irish public intellectual about how historians should
    write history and how their work should relate to their contemporary world.
    It identifies several unacknowledged intellectual debts O’Brien owed to
    influential twentieth-century thinkers — namely, the philosophers Michael
    Oakeshott and Maurice Merleau-Ponty and the sociologist C. Wright Mills. The
    article challenges the claim that O’Brien’s view of historiography underwent
    significant changes in response to the outbreak of violence in Northern
    Ireland during the late 1960s. On the contrary, it is argued that O’Brien’s
    thinking on these themes remained fundamentally unchanged from the mid 1950s
    until the end of his long career as a public intellectual.

    This book examines Irish women’s lives in the nineteenth and early twentieth
    centuries from a new angle, investigating how they inherited, bought, or
    started up businesses. Some guided their operations to impressive profit and
    growth, while others coped with devastating failure. The many and varied
    primary sources which inform Antonia Hart’s research place all these
    businesswomen in public-facing roles, in commercial environments, making
    economic decisions and operating with autonomy which they sought out and
    claimed. These were not unusual women. They were present in the main streets
    of towns and cities, their businesses both visible and unsurprising to
    passers-by.Women’s businesses mattered. They enabled employees, both women
    and men, to earn their livings. They paid fees for professional services to
    accounting and legal firms. They contributed to the local and national
    economies. They provided training, and sometimes accommodation, for
    apprentices. Women’s businesses mattered in the credit economy, not only in
    their extension of credit for goods and services, but also in the form of
    collateralised loans, from the pawnbroker’s counter, while the Dublin
    pawnbrokers also contributed an annual sum to the city policing budget.In
    the context of well-ventilated ideas about what a woman should be, many
    girls grew up seeing their teachers, mothers, sisters, and neighbours bring
    pragmatism and creativity into commercial lives. This book shows how private
    realities diverged from public ideals, and describes for the first time a
    robust and intriguing national heritage of Irish female entrepreneurship.

    When the Irish foreign service was formed in 1919, the Department of Foreign
    Affairs in Dublin lacked systematic policies for record-keeping. Based on a
    thorough understanding of the primary and secondary sources, this research
    focuses on the people, records management and material resources at work
    before the appointment of an official archivist in 1936. This article deals
    with the relevance of lawyers and journalists to the staff in Dublin,
    communication patterns, the employment of women, limited resources,
    legislation for records, and the influence of librarians during the period.

  abstract: >-
    Beginning in the late 1820s, gymnastics for adults and children became a
    noted phenomenon within some Irish cities. Predominantly led by foreign
    gymnastic instructors, the gymnastics wave marked a specific movement of
    transnationalism within Irish health and education. This article considers
    Dublin-based gymnastic instructors and physicians, weaving together
    histories of medicine, gender and transnationalism. Irish children’s bodies
    became a site of intense focus in the early nineteenth century, and medical
    and health tracts concerning children’s gymnastics reveal broader fears
    around the impact of modernity, the deficiencies of education and the
    socialisation of young people. Increasingly, children’s exercise became
    viewed as being of utmost importance to both the development of the
    individual and, more importantly, to the vitality of the nation itself. This
    contributes significantly to the historiography of Irish childhood by
    focusing not just on discourses, but on the bodies they sought to mould.

    "In the summer of 1847, over four hundred ships arrived in the Gulf of St
    Lawrence, carrying Irish men, women, and children who were fleeing the
    starvation and misery of the Great Potato Famine. Tens of thousands of
    famine refugees rebuilt their lives in different parts of Canada, in places
    urban and rural, Anglophone and Francophone. Though still a young province
    within the British Empire, Canada would be marked permanently and in
    significant ways by this mass migration. Canada and the Great Irish Famine
    examines how people confronted, experienced, and remembered the famine
    migration. Essays consider the transatlantic voyage; the collection of
    donations and organization of aid; the challenges encountered by the cities
    of Quebec, Saint John, Montreal, Toronto, Kingston, and Hamilton and their
    public debates over the impact of so many new arrivals; the accompanying
    problems of disease, destitution, mental illness, death and burial; the
    stories of orphaned children; and expressions of famine memory. The worst
    demographic catastrophe in nineteenth-century Europe inspired generations of
    political writings, artistic and literary endeavours, and commemorative
    practices, and it was woven into narratives of Irish nationalism and the
    founding of Canada. Canada and the Great Irish Famine provides a new
    perspective on the social outcomes of Ireland’s famine migration as well as
    on the resilience and adaptability of the receiving communities and the
    migrants themselves. William Jenkins is associate professor of history at
    York University and the current president of the Canadian Association for
    Irish Studies. He is the author of Between Raid and Rebellion: The Irish in
    Buffalo and Toronto, 1867–1916."-- Provided by publisher

    Peatlands – bogs, fens and heaths – are part of the Irish soul. Neither
    water nor land and yet both, they were once considered gateways to the
    otherworld. Bleak and beautiful, they are time capsules that hold a record
    of history going back thousands of years. They supported Irish life for
    generations, providing fuel and employment, and are home to flora and fauna
    found nowhere else.Carsten Krieger, the author and photographer behind Wild
    Ireland, Ireland's Wild Atlantic Way and many other titles, celebrates the
    magic and mystery of our peatlands. He looks at the origin of these
    habitats, the often dark traditions associated with the Irish peatlands, and
    how we can maintain the delicate balance between man and nature into the
    future.

    This article compares how early modern English travel accounts to Ireland,
    America, and Africa portrayed native women. It examines gendered tropes that
    reoccurred in all these writings, such as ease of childbirth, breast size,
    and breastfeeding over the shoulder. It argues that many of these tropes
    that helped shape the racialised thinking of indigenous people in America
    and Africa first appeared in English-written travel accounts to Ireland. In
    some examples, English travel writers in America and Africa made direct
    comparisons to Irish women. Accordingly, the article demonstrates that
    Ireland is significant for the study of early modern English imperialism.
    Perceptions of gender were central in formulating English racial perceptions
    of the Other in the New World, but there was nothing unique about these
    tropes. In other words, there was nothing particularly ‘African’ about
    English perceptions of African women. English imperialists perceived Native
    American, African, and Irish women through the same lens. The article shows
    that early modern notions of racial difference were constructed less on
    overt characteristics particular to a geographical zone of contact—for
    example, the skin colour of Africans—and more on certain transferable
    gendered tropes that framed perceptions of native women across all three
    continents.

  abstract: >-
    The contemporary LGBTQ+ history of Northern Ireland has emerged relatively
    recently. This article examines two negative models that fed into
    understandings of male homosexuality between the early 1960s and the end of
    the 1980s, and some of the discourses that emanated from them. Using
    contemporary comment, theological and medical writings, and oral history
    testimonies, this article charts the fortunes of models of ‘sickness’ and
    ‘sinfulness’. A campaign to secure law reform in the 1970s forced churches
    to confront the ‘problem’ of homosexuality. I demonstrate the complexity of
    responses from two major Protestant churches, the tentative emergence of a
    challenge from radical Christians and how this landscape has been obscured
    by the notoriety of an infamous fundamentalist campaign. As was the case in
    England, the notion of homosexuality as a pathology gained traction in
    Northern Ireland only in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to medical conversion
    practices, such as aversion therapy, which attempted to ‘cure’ men of
    same-sex desire. However, discourses conflicted, with regional social
    conditions resulting in ‘sickness’ co-existing uneasily with ‘sin’. And
    although it was opposed by a strain of evangelical thought, social
    conditions fostered by conservative religiosity enabled pathologisation to
    linger on through the 1980s.

  abstract: >-
    The end of the nineteenth century saw the emergence of nationalism as the
    primary ideological underpinning of Australian identity, defining the
    broader Australian people as a culturally British, Protestant community.
    Such developments drew strength from key events of the early twentieth
    century, such as Australian federation and the Great War. Although
    historians have conceded that Irish Australians could adhere to the cultural
    tenets of Anglo-Australia, they have overlooked the extent to which
    Irish-Australian Catholics, especially those from the middle class, adopted
    Britishness as an integral part of their ethno-religious identity.
    Middle-class Catholic individuals, families and groups negotiated the extent
    of their Irishness to suit their needs within economic, social and cultural
    spaces dominated by Australia’s Protestant majority. This article argues
    that the expression of Britishness was an intrinsic part of Catholics’
    middle-class ambitions, as they sought to rectify their implicit ‘otherness’
    in an Australia committed to a myth of national unity on non-Irish, and
    non-Catholic, terms.

  abstract: >-
    A study of an unexpected large-scale migration, of the many issues it gave
    rise to, and of its aftermath. Although Ireland is usually thought of as a
    place from which people emigrate, there was in the early eighteenth century
    a significant immigration to Ireland of 'poor Palatines' from southwestern
    states of the Holy Roman Empire. This book explores this mass immigration
    and the related issues. It outlines what caused the sudden movement of so
    many people in one six-month period - successive wars, widespread
    devastation, famine and the notably cold winter of 1708/09. It discusses the
    role of pan European Protestantism, with churchmen working alongside
    colonists and shows how the migration was a Whig initiative, supported by a
    major public relations exercise in which leading literary figures
    participated. It situates the migration within the migration of poor
    Palatines more widely in Britain and Britain's American colonies and
    examines the subsequent evolution of the Palatine community as they
    struggled with problems of identity and worked to settle and integrate, in
    some cases making significant contributions to Irish life. Throughout, the
    book highlights the debates, familiar at present, as to whether migrants
    were potential contributors to the wealth of a nation, or simply a likely
    drain on a nation's resources.

  abstract: "The crown was the symbol of British power in Ireland, and in December 1921 opponents of the Anglo-Irish Treaty claimed that its terms tied Ireland to the Crown forever. The new Irish Free State would be within the British Commonwealth, with limited sovereignty. And some believed it would stay that way if the Treaty was accepted.\_And yet, within 16 years, Ireland had become a republic. A dozen years after that, it acquired the name as well and removed any ambiguity about its constitutional status by formally leaving the Commonwealth. And all without the firing of a shot.\_This peaceful revolution had been achieved by a succession of governments of different parties and a cast of characters that included a monarch prepared to surrender his throne for love; a British prime minister who made Irish neutrality possible and another who did his best to bully or bribe Ireland into World War II. What had seemed impossible in 1921 had been achieved through relentless pressure, considerable skill and no small amount of luck. This is the story of how it happened."

    This article explores the Royal Irish Constabulary Commemoration controversy
    of 2020. It argues that the Irish government’s attempts to separate the
    ‘good’ (Irish) recruits from ‘bad’ (British) recruits to the force can be
    linked to longer-running trends in Irish collective memory, and is an
    example of what has been termed ‘commemorative memory’: where historical
    narratives are used (instrumentally) ‘to legitimise collective identities
    and social institutions’. The RIC commemoration, it is argued, bore
    resemblances to the revisionist controversy of the 1980s, which saw debates
    about the morality of violence where the (legitimate) campaign of the ‘old
    IRA’ was contrasted with the (illegitimate) campaign of the Provisional IRA.
    The result, it contends, was that the government’s attempt at an inclusive
    commemoration in a ‘post-imperial’ setting inadvertently pathologised those
    of British heritage in Ireland.

  abstract: >-
    This groundbreaking study reveals the fascinating international dimension of
    the Irish Revolution (1919-1923), exploring how a small nation's fight for
    independence reverberated across the globe. The Irish republican
    counter-state strategy required seeking diplomatic recognition abroad. In
    addition to a foreign affairs department, a publicity ministry was created
    to maximise the cultural impact of the Irish struggle within a growing
    international discourse on small, emerging states and the rise of
    anti-imperialist sentiments. Through meticulous research and a compelling
    narrative, the book reveals how Irish revolutionaries were compelled by
    circumstances to devise an unconventional diplomatic strategy: unable to
    persuade governments to support the Irish Revolution directly, they
    endeavoured to influence foreign public opinion and indirectly pressure
    governments to support Irish independence. The volume examines: The birth of
    Irish international diplomacy, including: establishment of Ireland's first
    diplomatic missions; Irish propaganda networks across multiple countries;
    and creation of the Irish Bulletin in multiple languages to shape
    international opinion.Global impact including: operations across Europe, the
    United States, and the British Empire; mobilisation of the influential Irish
    diaspora; strategic use of cultural and economic connections to advance
    Ireland's cause; and responses by oppressed nationalities, Zionists and
    revolutionary writers as far away as China and Russia. Revolutionary
    innovation, including: pioneering the use of international public diplomacy;
    media strategies to counter British narratives; and instituting a diplomatic
    service that would influence Irish foreign policy for decades. This book is
    essential reading. It reveals how the Irish Revolution was not merely a
    domestic struggle but developed an international campaign that informed
    other emerging small nations. Drawing on multiple previously unutilised and
    underutilised diplomatic archives and international sources, it provides a
    more comprehensive analysis of how Irish revolutionaries transformed the
    national revolution into a global campaign. For readers interested in
    international relations, revolutionary movements, or modern Irish history,
    this volume offers unprecedented insights into how an emerging nation
    navigated great power politics and sought to shape its own destiny on the
    world stage. The story it tells resonates with contemporary questions about
    national sovereignty, public diplomacy, and the role of small states in
    international affairs. This thoroughly researched work provides a unique
    account of Ireland's emergence onto the international stage, offering
    lessons for understanding modern diplomacy and national liberation
    movements. Whether you're a diplomatic historian, a student of Irish
    studies, or simply interested in how small nations can impact global
    affairs, this book provides essential insights into a pivotal moment in
    modern Irish history, which coincided with the turbulent period of
    international history after the First World War. It comprehensively outlines
    the activities of the Irish Revolution's diplomatic and publicity arms to
    garner international support, highlighting the complementary nature of these
    efforts overseas with the domestic Irish struggle.

    Sir Richard John Griffith was the acknowledged ‘father of Irish geology’ and
    his fossil collection was without doubt the single most valuable and
    important Irish palaeontological collection to be assembled by any
    individual in the nineteenth century. Being one of the earliest collections
    to be used for systematic descriptions of Paleozoic fossils it held the type
    material for over five hundred species and twenty-eight genera that were new
    to science. The original work on the collection was by Frederick McCoy who
    produced two volumes describing the collection in 1844 and 1846. Most
    surviving specimens are in the National Museum of Ireland – Natural History,
    with other important holdings in the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge, and
    Trinity College Dublin.

  abstract: "The British Isles hold a unique position in the history of art, a place where local traditions fuse with international ideas in extraordinary waysAt once isolated by coastal boundaries, yet also part of larger networks of diverse peoples, these islands have always benefited from a dual perspective. Artistic creativity in the British Isles stretches back to Ice Age engravings of reindeer, horses and birds. International networks were already shaping prehistoric art and by 1,000 CE artists working in Britain and Ireland were using lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, walrus tusks from Greenland, garnets from India and elephant ivory from Africa. The Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and Normans introduced new styles from overseas, as did later European artists, attracted by the wealth of royal courts. Art was traded and looted across the British empire by colonial explorers, merchants and the military. In the course of the 20th century these islands have been a refuge, but also a place where migrants have faced resistance. Sculptures by Jewish immigrants fleeing Nazi death camps, paintings by post-war Caribbean artists and protest murals sparked by the Troubles in Northern Ireland all express artists’ complex relationships with the idea of home. Artists today such as Grayson Perry, Lubaina Himid, Yinka Shonibare, Rachel Whiteread and Edmund de Waal consciously reflect on this long history in their work, exploring concepts of identity and belonging. Fresh, pacy and surprising,\_The Art Isles\_tells the story of why art in Britain and Ireland is so rich and dynamic – and why it has always extended far beyond geographical borders."

    This paper details the background to proposals of the Irish Department of
    Education in 1974 to introduce a new school subject entitled “Irish Studies”
    to complement rather than replace the long-standing Irish language and
    literature courses that the authorities of all post-primary schools had to
    ensure were taught from 1922. From studying both areas, it was argued,
    students would develop a more inclusive notion of Irish identity than had
    hitherto been promoted through the education system. However, subsequent
    developments were maintained only for about five years. That outcome meant
    that an opportunity was lost between then and the present day for preparing
    Irish citizens to be able to contest xenophobic expressions of Irish
    nationalism based on discredited interpretations of Irish history.

  abstract: >-
    As part of the seventeenth colonial conflagration, known as “Wars of the
    Three Kingdoms,” incidents of sexual violence—stripping, castration,
    mutilation, rape, gang rape, and reproductive violations—occurred against
    women and some men across Ireland. The historical and legal evidence for
    this violence was recorded in witness statements that form part of an
    archive, known as the “1641 Depositions.” This article examines this
    extraordinary archive, now housed in Trinity College Dublin and published
    online, especially the witness testimony provided by Protestant women. It
    explores how sexual violence was reported and then politicized. Though
    testimony that related to sexual violence was rarely used in the courtroom,
    Protestant propagandists—from the seventeenth to the twentieth
    centuries—manipulated these accounts to instill fear and justify
    retribution.

    Solidarity and Pressure is the first full-length study of the Irish
    Anti-Apartheid Movement (IAAM). Founded in April 1964, the IAAM spearheaded
    fundraising efforts, organized events, lobbied Irish politicians, and
    actively promoted the struggle against Apartheid South Africa across local,
    international, political, and cultural spheres. Despite its modest size,
    Ireland's movement was ranked by the African National Congress as one of the
    strongest in terms of solidarity, alongside the Dutch and Scandinavian
    movements.Drawing on seventy interviews, the IAAM's own records, and private
    papers from Anti-Apartheid activists, Solidarity and Pressure captures the
    exhilarating story of the IAAM across three decades: how it thrived in
    Ireland due to the historical context of national liberation, along with the
    opposition it faced in the Cold War era. It charts the birth of the
    movement, its engagement with southern Africa, overlaps with the conflict in
    Northern Ireland, the opposition it faced from authorities in Ireland and
    South Africa, the Dunnes Stores strike (1984-87), its relationship with
    Irish political parties and governments, and its advocacy for sporting and
    cultural boycotts. The book assesses the contribution of the IAAM's
    enigmatic founder Kader Asmal (1934-2011), and his co-founder and wife,
    Louise Asmal, who championed the ANC's strategy of forging broad political
    coalitions, successfully drawing in members from all Irish political parties
    to advance the Anti-Apartheid struggle.

    This article discusses how women teachers experienced the Irish
    revolutionary period during the time of experience, rather than in the light
    of what came afterwards. It argues that, while new scholarship generally
    succeeded in writing women into the historical narrative of the
    revolutionary period, it failed to explore the experiences of women
    teachers. The article draws on several archival collections, to present an
    account of emotions of protest amongst women teachers, education faculty and
    student teachers at Carysfort College Dublin. It also notes how convents and
    convent school buildings were sometimes used as “safe houses” and presents
    archival evidence to support this finding.

    From remote islands to sunken lands, Gareth Roddy traces how travel writing
    and tourism shaped the cultural and political imagination of the British and
    Irish West between 1880 and 1940. The west has long gripped the imagination.
    In Atlantic Isles, Gareth Roddy examines the cultural and political
    prominence of the "westward gaze," which flourished in late-nineteenth
    century Britain and Ireland. From Cornish cliffs and Welsh mountains to
    Hebridean islands and the Connemara highlands, the west was an imagined
    geography that transcended the national territories of these isles. In the
    west, geologists uncovered ancient layers of rock, ethnologists described
    older racial "types," philologists looked for the survival of Celtic
    languages, and antiquarians and archaeologists marveled at megalithic
    monuments at the Atlantic coastline.  This book draws on wide-ranging
    contemporary sources, including works of geology, philology, ethnology,
    history, geography, archaeology, folklore, literature, sociology, and an
    extensive collection of travel writing that popularized western landscapes
    among readers and tourists who explored the increasingly accessible west by
    road, rail, and steamer. Atlantic Isles reveals that western landscapes were
    especially powerful spaces of modern enchantment, where stories of sunken
    lands and mythical islands produced a sense of mystery and wonder in a
    supposedly disenchanted world. The significance of western landscapes for
    national identities is well known, but this book demonstrates that the west
    was also central to debates about Britishness and to the bold attempt to
    construct a narrative of multinational union that claimed deep historical
    roots at a time when the subject of Home Rule periodically dominated
    political debate.

    Historians continue to debate what form colonial rule took in early modern
    Ireland. This article explores how the reception and resistance to
    anglicisation, located in the everyday body language of submission and
    subordination encoded in gesture, might be understood in the experience of
    colonial rule. Exploring the gestural code operating in early modern
    Ireland, this article examines the role of body politics in the reception of
    and reaction to English rule. English ‘manners and apparel’ were central to
    the project of anglicisation. The body played a central role in representing
    and articulating social hierarchies in the early modern world. Body language
    offered a troubling everyday reminder of the inequalities signalled in the —
    non-reciprocal or non-reciprocated — gestures expected of ‘subordinates’
    towards ‘superiors’. If the enforcement of the gestural order was important
    to the establishment of English rule, this also made gesture a focus for
    resistance and opposition. A body politics that exploited a shared
    understanding of the meaning of particular gestures could be drawn on in
    both everyday politics and collective protests to subvert, resist and
    retaliate against the political agenda of anglicisation. Looking forward to
    the eighteenth century and beyond state action, the article calls for more
    work on gesture.

    A colourised photographic portrait of Sir Richard John Griffith (1784–1878)
    dating from 1870 has been recently donated to the Geological Society of
    London. It shows the sitter in a typical pose surrounded by items of
    geological interest, including his Wollaston Medal and a geological map
    published in 1853. This is a rare and hitherto undocumented portrait of this
    important Irish public servant and geoscientist, and it and the various
    components depicted are described and discussed here.

    In the second decade of the 1800s Richard John Griffith was preparing a
    geological map of Ireland. This was to finally be published in 1838 on a
    small scale with a larger quarter-inch map appearing in the following year.
    Recently, a water-coloured manuscript geological map of Ireland has been
    located in the George Bellas Greenough collection of the Geological Society
    of London. It represents a collaborative trans-Irish Sea effort between
    Griffith and Greenough to display Ireland’s geological structure, and
    probably dates from 1814. On a copy of Alexander Taylor’s 1793 map of
    Ireland Greenough provided marginal notes, delineated some geological
    boundaries with particular attention paid to County Donegal, and provided
    the names of nine lithological types in no apparent stratigraphic order. He
    then sent the otherwise blank map to Griffith, who applied the watercolour
    wash to show the distribution of those lithologies, before he returned the
    map to London. This manuscript geological map of Ireland may pre-date that
    attributed to Alexander Nimmo, which dates from no later than 1822.
