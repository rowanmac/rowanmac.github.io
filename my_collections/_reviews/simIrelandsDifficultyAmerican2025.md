abstract: "Aiding Ireland is a brisk, readable book on an important subject. Anelise\
  \ Hanson Shrout aims to explain \u201Cthe emergence of ideas about international\
  \ obligations in the face of disaster\u201D in the 1840s (2). The disaster that\
  \ she refers to is, of course, the Irish Famine, which prompted, as she puts it,\
  \ \u201Cone of the first truly global humanitarian relief efforts\u201D (3). Over\
  \ eight chapters she charts how those relief efforts drew on interpretations of\
  \ the famine that sometimes had very little to do with its victims and rather more\
  \ to do with donors\u2019 own immediate material and ideological concerns. Each\
  \ chapter takes us a little further from Ireland. The final chapter intriguingly\
  \ (and sensitively) probes donations offered by Indigenous Americans, acts which\
  \ have been commemorated in Ireland in recent years. Along the way Shrout takes\
  \ in debates about free trade; imperial obligation; US expansionism; transatlantic\
  \ land reform; and the contest over enslavement in the US South."
