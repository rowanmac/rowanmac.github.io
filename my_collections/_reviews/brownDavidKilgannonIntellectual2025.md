abstract: "Intellectual Disability and Ireland, 1947\u20131996: Towards a Full Life?\
  \ by David Kilgannon draws from his PhD thesis, sponsored by a Wellcome Trust Doctoral\
  \ Studentship. Kilgannon\u2019s research is warmly welcomed, as the history of disabled\
  \ people in Ireland remains mostly untrodden. This work plots the evolution of statutory\
  \ disability policy. At the beginning of the period, there was a focus on the protection\
  \ and segregation of intellectually disabled people. By the period\u2019s end, the\
  \ approach had changed to caring within the community and striving for a \u2018\
  normal\u2019 life.Kilgannon\u2019s work is meticulously and skilfully researched\
  \ using a rich range of sources and archives, including the archives of Lenus, University\
  \ College Dublin, Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland, Dublin Diocesan, RT\xC9\
  \ and Royal Physicians of Ireland. Additional records utilised by Kilgannon came\
  \ from the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland organisational records, patient\
  \ registers from St John\u2019s Hospital and St Columba\u2019s Psychiatric Hospital,\
  \ as well as records from the Department of Finance."
