abstract: In the last thirty years, Ireland has been the most successful country in
  Europe in using Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) to bring employment and prosperity
  to its economy. Using low rates of corporation tax and the up-skilling of its labour
  force, as well as drawing on strong cultural connections with the United States,
  it has been able to attract a range of largely American multinationals to build
  industrial sectors focused on exporting into the European Single Market. Today around
  half of all manufacturing employment in the country is in the hands of such companies.
  But this successful policy mix was a long time in the making, and in this book,
  Frank Barry traces its roots back to the foundation of an independent Ireland and
  through to the crucial decision to enter the European Common Market, along with
  Britain and Denmark, in 1972.
