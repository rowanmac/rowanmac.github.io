abstract: "Media technology today connects potential donors to sufferers of humanitarian\
  \ crises across the globe. Like most other phenomena, this form of international\
  \ philanthropy has a rich history. In Aiding Ireland: The Great Famine and the Rise\
  \ of Transnational Philanthropy, Anelise Hanson Shrout contributes to the Irish\
  \ famine\u2019s deep historiography by portraying the famine as one of the first\
  \ truly global humanitarian relief efforts (3). This fine intellectual study provides\
  \ an alternative explanation for the complex motivations behind disparate groups\u2019\
  \ charitable support of starving Irish families."
