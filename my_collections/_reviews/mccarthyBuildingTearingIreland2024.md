abstract: "\u2018Nations,\u2019 political geographer Jim MacLaughlin tells us, \u2018\
  literally have to be built from the ground up.\u2019 During the Irish Revolution,\
  \ republicans engaged in the construction of a counter-state which included the\
  \ sporadic application of alternative policing arrangements and a judiciary in the\
  \ form of D\xE1il courts, as well as a representative assembly that was driven underground\
  \ for much of the War of Independence. However, several recent and highly original\
  \ works of scholarship underline once again that the revolutionary period was as\
  \ much about destroying British state apparatus and perceived symbols of colonialism\
  \ as it was about creating a new nation-state. This thread of destruction has been\
  \ explored from a micro-level (the burning of a village) to a national level (the\
  \ burning of roughly 300 country houses). Justin Dolan Stover's highly anticipated\
  \ Enduring ruin examines environmental destruction between 1916 and 1923 utilising\
  \ a broad definition of environment that incorporates man-made structures, and their\
  \ destruction, alongside rural landscapes. Stover's palpable rendering of the Easter\
  \ Rising, for example, contends that \u2018artillery bombardment, machine-gun fire,\
  \ ensuing fires, looting, the collapse of asbestos-lined tenements, human and animal\
  \ casualties, and odours indicative of unattended death grounded the rebellion's\
  \ ruinous scope\u2019 (p. 8). Enduring ruin innovatively elucidates the impact of\
  \ this unique \u2018sensory stamp\u2019 on combatants and civilians while chronicling\
  \ how propagandists utilised the imagery and language of the Great War to cultivate\
  \ a sense of victimhood and elicit international sympathy (pp 12\u201313, 112\u2013\
  18). Other chapters examine the impact of less overtly political environmental damage\
  \ and the impact of reprisals by crown forces. Like Donlon and Dooley's monographs,\
  \ Stover tactfully considers the interaction between landscape and people throughout,\
  \ drawing attention to the important area of the revolutionary period's impact on\
  \ the mental health of combatants and civilians (pp 74, 92\u20137). This work adds\
  \ a highly original perspective by presenting the impact of tree felling, road trenching\
  \ and incendiarism, contrasting the \u2018romanticism\u2019 of sawing trees \u2018\
  by hand under the cover of darkness\u2019 with \u2018the disillusionment of the\
  \ mechanised evisceration of nature experienced along the Western Front\u2019 (p.\
  \ 61). Alongside using weather reports to illustrate how \u2018extreme weather did\
  \ not stymy guerrilla activity\u2019, the author also employs a sample of 2,183\
  \ incidents of \u2018landscape manipulation and ensuing damage to the built and\
  \ natural environment\u2019 which, like the burning of big houses, correlates to\
  \ the more violent areas of the country (pp 70\u201373)."
