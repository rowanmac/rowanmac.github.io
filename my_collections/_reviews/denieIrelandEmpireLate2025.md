abstract: "Ireland\u2019s relationship with the British Empire has long interested\
  \ scholars, although in its early stages Irish imperial studies focused largely\
  \ on Nationalist opposition to empire or on debates over Ireland\u2019s precise\
  \ colonial or imperial status. Happily, in the past ten years or so a consensus\
  \ has been reached that Ireland occupied a hybrid position, both colonial and imperial,\
  \ which has in turn allowed more space for studies that explore the variety, depth\
  \ and ambiguities of Irish imperial sensibilities and experiences. Fergal O\u2019\
  Leary\u2019s new book is one such work, examining how empire was presented, understood\
  \ and debated in Irish society during the era of the New Imperialism. O\u2019Leary\
  \ uses a series of topical studies grouped in three broad categories (Politics,\
  \ Culture and Society) to chart the extent of Irish interest and involvement in\
  \ empire as well as the ways in which its experiences and outlook differed from\
  \ the rest of the United Kingdom. A central theme of the book is that Ireland in\
  \ this period was simultaneously a colonial (or perhaps anticolonial) and imperial\
  \ society that witnessed the growth of both nationalist and imperial/super-regional\
  \ identities."
