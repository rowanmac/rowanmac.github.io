I have more books on the go then I'll ever be able to realistically finish before I go to Shanghai in >2 months. Christopher Hill's *Society and Puritanism in Pre-Revolutionary England* has been a pleasure to pick away at everytime I go home. He writes so close to the bone of the sources, with a tone almost conversational without losing dignity, and a great deal of precision. It is a transparent sort of history writing, he never hides that it is a construction built from disperate sources, cohesion comes from his mastery, his ability to be in conversation with all these sources and put them all into conversation with each other. I rarely read history this well written. Although I have no idea of the books current relevance in the scholarship of the English revolution, reading it for the gist of things, and for an education in history writing is more than enough. I'll finish it, and the rest of the beautiful Verso editions of Hill, one day, maybe in a year or so.

I have also picked back up *The Posthumous Memoirs of Br√°s Cubas* by Machado De Assis, after a year or two of letting it lie fallow, enjoying it much more the second time around, very funny, would love to read it in Portugues one day. Robert Walser's *Berlin Stories*
