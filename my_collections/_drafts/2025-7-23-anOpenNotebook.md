I've been studying history at university for about five years now, and feel not much closer than when I began to understanding the method of history.
This is a little embarssing since I began a complete novice, not even having a particular interest in history to begin with, and have remained, in the subsequent years, in a state of mystery as to what history actually is and how to *do* it.
I once read on the Wikipedia page of the musical project *Songs: Ohia* that Jason Molina, its creator, tried, out of in my view misplaced sense of shame, to make music as if it were a 9-5 job, clocking in in the morning, sitting down to make music no matter the state of his inspiritation and then stopping at 5.
