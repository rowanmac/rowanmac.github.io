abstract: More Irish personnel served in the Italian campaign than in any theatre
  of the Second World War. The greatest numbers were in the Army but airmen and sailors
  also played important roles. From the first actions in Sicily on 10 July 1943 until
  the German surrender in Italy on 2 May 1945, Irish personnel were in the front line.
  Those in the combat support services also gave outstanding service, as did medical
  officers, nurses and chaplains. Many were decorated. At least one was recommended
  for a posthumous Victoria Cross and there were numerous awards of the DSO, DCM,
  MC and MM as well as Mentions in Despatches. For most there were no decorations,
  only the Italy Star; and the service of many was marked only by a headstone or a
  name on a memorial. Their stories are equally inspiring and deserve to be told whether
  they were tankmen, gunners, sappers, signallers, infantry or the faithful members
  of support services such as drivers and mechanics or nurses who were often under
  threat from air attack or artillery fire. At the other end of the spectrum, many
  of the commanders, including General Montgomery, Admiral Cunningham and Field Marshal
  Alexander were also Irish. Drawing on personal memoirs, published works, official
  records and interviews with veterans, as well as his own in-depth knowledge of the
  Italian campaign, Richard Doherty reveals the service of Irish units and Irish personnel
  of all ranks and throughout the campaign, especially during the major battles.
