abstract: The ' long seventeenth century' was a time of enormous religious and political
  change in Ireland, but there has never been a satisfactory study of the Church of
  Ireland throughout this turbulent period. This book fills the gap, drawing on rich
  research undertaken in recent years by a number of eminent scholars. It considers
  the way in which the church changed over time, focusing on crucial ' hinge' events
  such as the mid-century rebellion and Cromwellian occupation, and the existential
  threat posed to the church in the Jacobite period. It looks at many different facets
  of the Church of Ireland in the period, including education, music, and the acquisition
  and use of silver; it covers not only important bishops but also ordinary parish
  clergy, and reveals the lives of clergy and laity in the more distant provinces
  as well as metropolitan Dublin. Together, the essays present a composite picture
  of a church in a time of change.
