abstract: "The origins and evolution of Irish American identity, from colonial times\
  \ through the twentieth century \_ \u201CSubtly provocative. . . . [Meagher] traces\
  \ the making and remaking of Irish America through several iterations and shows\
  \ the impact of religion on each.\u201D\u2014Terry Golway, Wall Street Journal \_\
  \ As millions of Irish immigrants and their descendants created community in the\
  \ United States over the centuries, they neither remained Irish nor simply became\
  \ American. Instead, they created a culture and defined an identity that was unique\
  \ to their circumstances, a new people that they would continually reinvent: Irish\
  \ Americans. \_ Historian Timothy J. Meagher traces the Irish American experience\
  \ from the first Irishman to step ashore at Roanoke in 1585 to John F. Kennedy\u2019\
  s election as president in 1960. As he chronicles how Irish American culture evolved,\
  \ Meagher looks at how various groups adapted and thrived\u2014Protestants and Catholics,\
  \ immigrants and American born, those located in different geographic corners of\
  \ the country. He describes how Irish Americans made a living, where they worshiped,\
  \ and when they married, and how Irish American politicians found particular success,\
  \ from ward bosses on the streets of New York, Boston, and Chicago to the presidency.\
  \ \_ In this sweeping history, Meagher reveals how the Irish American identity was\
  \ forged, how it has transformed, and how it has held lasting influence on American\
  \ culture."
