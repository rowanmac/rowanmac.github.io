abstract: 'Mediating Cultural Memory is the first book to analyze the relationship
  between cultural memory, national identity and the changing media ecology in early
  eighteenth-century Britain. Leith Davis focuses on five pivotal episodes in the
  histories of England, Scotland and Ireland: the 1688 ''Glorious'' Revolution; the
  War of the Two Kings in Ireland (1688-91); the Scottish colonial enterprise in Darien
  (1695-1700); the 1715 Jacobite Rising; and the 1745 Jacobite Rising. She explores
  the initial inscription of these episodes in forms such as ballads, official documents,
  manuscript newsletters, correspondence, newspapers and popular histories, and examines
  how counter-memories of these events continued to circulate in later mediations.
  Bringing together Memory Studies, Book History and British Studies, Mediating Cultural
  Memory offers a new interpretation of the early eighteenth century as a crucial
  stage in the development of cultural memory and illuminates the processes of remembrance
  and forgetting that have shaped the nation of Britain.'
