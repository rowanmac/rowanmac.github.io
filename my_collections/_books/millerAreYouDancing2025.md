abstract: From the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, showbands were all the rage among Ireland's
  dancing audiences. Performing covers of rock 'n' roll and pop hits from American
  and British weekly Top 10 charts, they riveted their fans, dismayed many parish
  priests, and offered Irish youth a taste of modernism and pop culture from outside
  of Ireland.In Are You Dancing?, Rebecca S. Miller tells the story of how these working-class
  bands brought new sounds and choreographies to the Irish and Northern Irish pop
  landscape. Both as a response to and an agent in Ireland's changing economic landscape,
  showbands quickly grew into a hugely lucrative commercial industry. At the same
  time, they nudged open doors for Irish women to take to the stage as pop stars,
  rewarded a generation of entrepreneurs, and created the template for Ireland's popular
  music industry. Miller draws upon interviews with more than 80 musicians, agents,
  managers, fans, and clergy, to reveal the vast interplay of social, economic, and
  cultural changes that ensued with the Irish showband era.Drawing upon an extensive
  catalog of ethnographic and archival research, Miller presents an overlooked era
  of musical performances that revolutionized Irish entertainment.
