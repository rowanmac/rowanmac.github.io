abstract: Most of the literature concerning the momentous challenges facing Irish
  American Catholics in the first two decades of the twentieth century pay but scant
  attention to the role played in addressing them by the American Church. Among the
  myriad political, social, cultural and economic issues confronting Irish American
  Catholics none stand out as prominently as the unabated burden of combatting scurrilous
  attacks upon them by nativist forces, the task of proving themselves as loyal American
  citizens, and navigating the perilous waves in advancing the course of directing
  Irish American nationalism and the cause of Ireland's freedom. Patriotism is a Catholic
  Virtue ferrets out the impact the institutional Church played in affecting the course
  of action Irish American Catholics took regarding these three crucial missions.
  Whereas the task of confronting the assaults of nativism, seemingly the natural
  task for the institutional Church, this study provides extensive evidence of the
  relentless defense of Catholic virtue conducted by diocesan newspapers. Similarly,
  the mission of promoting Catholics as loyal American citizens was largely left in
  the hands of the American hierarchy, its clergy, newspapers and Catholic societies
  and affiliates. Lastly, this book provides evidence that the Church may well have
  played the decisive role in guiding its Irish American faithful along paths that,
  while conservatively promoting Irish nationalism, did not jeopardize an "American
  First" policy for Catholics. All of this was accomplished in the crucible of an
  emerging worldwide war.
