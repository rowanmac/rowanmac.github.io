abstract: 'This groundbreaking study reveals the fascinating international dimension
  of the Irish Revolution (1919-1923), exploring how a small nation''s fight for independence
  reverberated across the globe. The Irish republican counter-state strategy required
  seeking diplomatic recognition abroad. In addition to a foreign affairs department,
  a publicity ministry was created to maximise the cultural impact of the Irish struggle
  within a growing international discourse on small, emerging states and the rise
  of anti-imperialist sentiments. Through meticulous research and a compelling narrative,
  the book reveals how Irish revolutionaries were compelled by circumstances to devise
  an unconventional diplomatic strategy: unable to persuade governments to support
  the Irish Revolution directly, they endeavoured to influence foreign public opinion
  and indirectly pressure governments to support Irish independence. The volume examines:
  The birth of Irish international diplomacy, including: establishment of Ireland''s
  first diplomatic missions; Irish propaganda networks across multiple countries;
  and creation of the Irish Bulletin in multiple languages to shape international
  opinion.Global impact including: operations across Europe, the United States, and
  the British Empire; mobilisation of the influential Irish diaspora; strategic use
  of cultural and economic connections to advance Ireland''s cause; and responses
  by oppressed nationalities, Zionists and revolutionary writers as far away as China
  and Russia. Revolutionary innovation, including: pioneering the use of international
  public diplomacy; media strategies to counter British narratives; and instituting
  a diplomatic service that would influence Irish foreign policy for decades. This
  book is essential reading. It reveals how the Irish Revolution was not merely a
  domestic struggle but developed an international campaign that informed other emerging
  small nations. Drawing on multiple previously unutilised and underutilised diplomatic
  archives and international sources, it provides a more comprehensive analysis of
  how Irish revolutionaries transformed the national revolution into a global campaign.
  For readers interested in international relations, revolutionary movements, or modern
  Irish history, this volume offers unprecedented insights into how an emerging nation
  navigated great power politics and sought to shape its own destiny on the world
  stage. The story it tells resonates with contemporary questions about national sovereignty,
  public diplomacy, and the role of small states in international affairs. This thoroughly
  researched work provides a unique account of Ireland''s emergence onto the international
  stage, offering lessons for understanding modern diplomacy and national liberation
  movements. Whether you''re a diplomatic historian, a student of Irish studies, or
  simply interested in how small nations can impact global affairs, this book provides
  essential insights into a pivotal moment in modern Irish history, which coincided
  with the turbulent period of international history after the First World War. It
  comprehensively outlines the activities of the Irish Revolution''s diplomatic and
  publicity arms to garner international support, highlighting the complementary nature
  of these efforts overseas with the domestic Irish struggle.'
