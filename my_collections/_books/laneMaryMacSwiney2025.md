abstract: "Until now, in-depth analysis of key female figures in Irish republicanism\
  \ in the early twentieth century has been limited. Mary MacSwiney was one of the\
  \ most single-minded anti-Treaty women, leading Eamon de Valera to describe her\
  \ as \u2018incorrigible\u2019. Rather than just dismiss MacSwiney as one-dimensional\
  \ in her opposition to the Treaty and in her continued political intractability,\
  \ this biography seeks to place her political life within the centre of the turn\
  \ of the twentieth-century republican narrative and understand why she was increasingly\
  \ viewed as a virago. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ To say contemporary gender roles\
  \ played a part in reducing MacSwiney to a cipher for extreme republicanism limits\
  \ a fuller understanding of her political life. Her uncompromising stance against\
  \ the evils of compromise during the Treaty negotiations was indelibly formed by\
  \ the experience of watching her brother Terence MacSwiney die on hunger strike\
  \ in Brixton Jail in 1920, and the trauma she experienced. She witnessed an intimate\
  \ act of self-sacrifice which bound her to a belief that her task was to continue\
  \ her brother\u2019s fidelity to a separatist republic. Betrayal of the republic,\
  \ for her, would meant betrayal of a brother she loved and admired. Mary MacSwiney\
  \ situates this standout figure in the context of her tightly knit family, tracing\
  \ her political evolution from suffrage and cultural revival activism to advanced\
  \ nationalism. While the focus of MacSwiney\u2019s political action was Cork, from\
  \ 1920 onwards she began to assume a progressively more important role in Irish\
  \ politics at a national and international level, including American tours, a central\
  \ role during the Civil War and within Sinn F\xE9in and a close political relationship\
  \ with de Valera. From 1926 onward, she was increasingly politically isolated and\
  \ marginalised as she sparred with members of Fianna F\xE1il in the press, seeking\
  \ to justify her continued refusal to engage with the reality of the Irish Free\
  \ State. Leading biographer of women in twentieth-century Irish history, Leeann\
  \ Lane delves into newly discovered archival material to interrogate MacSwiney\u2019\
  s oppositional stance to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. Mary\
  \ MacSwiney offers a comprehensive understanding of a misrepresented and marginalised\
  \ voice in early twentieth-century Irish politics."
