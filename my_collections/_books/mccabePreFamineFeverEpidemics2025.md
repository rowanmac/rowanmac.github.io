abstract: This book explores the workings of the Cork Street Fever Hospital in Dublin's
  south-western quarter in the decades after its opening in May 1804. The foundation
  of the hospital, its significant role with the wider international fever hospital
  movement, and its management and financial structures are discussed, as are the
  experiences both of medical staff (physicians, apothecaries and nurses) and of patients.
  Through case studies of the fever epidemics of 1817- 19 and 1826- 7, this book demonstrates
  that in ' normal' times and in times of crisis, the Cork Street Fever Hospital was
  central to efforts in curtailing the progress of contagion in Dublin city.
