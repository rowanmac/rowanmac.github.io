abstract: "In Thomas Drew and the Making of Victorian Belfast, Farrell analyzes the\
  \ career of \u201Cpolitical parson\u201D Thomas Drew (1800-70), creator of one of\
  \ the largest Church of Ireland congregations on the island and leading figure in\
  \ the Loyal Orange Order. Farrell demonstrates how Drew\u2019s success stemmed from\
  \ an adaptive combination of his fierce anti-Catholicism and populist Protestant\
  \ politics, the creation of social and spiritual outreach programs that placed Christ\
  \ Church at the center of west Belfast life, and the rapid growth of the northern\
  \ capital. At its core, the book highlights the synthetic nature of Drew\u2019s\
  \ appeal to a vital cross-class community of Belfast Protestant men and women, a\
  \ fact that underlines both the success of his ministry and the long-term durability\
  \ of sectarian lines of division in the city and province. The dynamics Farrell\
  \ discusses were also not confined to Ireland, and one of the book\u2019s central\
  \ features is the close attention paid to the ways that developments in Belfast\
  \ were linked to broader Atlantic and imperial contexts. Based on a wide array of\
  \ new and underutilized archival sources, Thomas Drew and the Making of Victorian\
  \ Belfast is the first detailed examination of not only Thomas Drew, but also the\
  \ relationships between anti-Catholicism, evangelical Protestantism, and populist\
  \ politics in early Victorian Belfast."
