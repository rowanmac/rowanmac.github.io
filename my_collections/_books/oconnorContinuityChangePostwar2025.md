abstract: "Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of authors, this book relays\
  \ the untold story of postwar migration between Ireland and Australia. Spanning\
  \ the period 1945\u20132024, it explores the experiences of migrants from the Republic\
  \ of Ireland and Northern Ireland and provides insights into the multiple reasons\
  \ these migrants came to Australia, factors which prompted permanency or return,\
  \ and the extent of continuity and change between recent arrivals and their historical\
  \ predecessors.Contemporary flows are examined through the lens of social, economic,\
  \ policy, and technological changes occurring at the time in Ireland, Australia,\
  \ and globally. Decades of economic boom and bust in Ireland, including the growth\
  \ and demise of the Celtic Tiger, the impact of government investment in education\
  \ in the Republic, and the Troubles in Northern Ireland, occurred alongside marked\
  \ changes in Australia\u2019s immigration policy. During this time, an increased\
  \ affordability of international travel and communication brought new dynamics to\
  \ the tyranny of distance that characterised historical flows. How contemporary\
  \ migrants from Ireland navigated these changes in terms of identity and belonging,\
  \ homesickness, and transnationalism are the key themes which are explored. The\
  \ role of Ireland\u2019s Government in relation to its migrant community in Australia\
  \ and the impact of COVID-19 are also considered.This book not only fills a gap\
  \ in Ireland\u2019s diaspora research but also contributes to migration studies\
  \ more broadly, particularly the experiences of invisible immigrants."
