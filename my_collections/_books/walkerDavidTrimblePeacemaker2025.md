abstract: "David Trimble was one of the most influential figures in modern British\
  \ and Irish history. A Nobel Laureate, he negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in\
  \ 1998 that helped to secure peace in Northern Ireland.In this first biography to\
  \ chart Trimble\u2019s life and death, award-winning journalist Stephen Walker vividly\
  \ details how this shy Belfast academic changed the political landscape of Northern\
  \ Ireland. With the cooperation of the Trimble family, Peacemaker offers unparalleled\
  \ insights into the life of a history maker: the first person to be elected First\
  \ Minister of Northern Ireland and the last Ulster unionist to hold that title.Using\
  \ interviews with his widow Lady Trimble and their grown-up children, the book colourfully\
  \ charts Trimble\u2019s story from the County Down city of Bangor, through the divisive\
  \ world of unionist politics, to his crowning moment at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony\
  \ in Oslo. It is a tale of how the leaders of unionism and nationalism worked together\
  \ to end decades of violence to compromise and share power."
