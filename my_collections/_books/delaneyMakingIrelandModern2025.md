abstract: 'A provocative and original reinterpretation of modern Irish history.There
  is a widespread misconception that Ireland became ''modern'' much later than its
  neighbours, in the 1960s and 1970s. This is grounded in several enduring stereotypes
  and caricatures: of Ireland as a ''timeless'' and unchanging ''land of saints and
  scholars''; of its society and culture in the long nineteenth century as puritanical,
  regressive, or archaic; of Gaelic language and culture as ''backward'' or inward-looking
  in contrast to a ''modern'' English counterpart; and of the island as natural and
  rural in the face of the urban and technological ''progress'' of modernity.Drawing
  on an extensive range of sources, from poetry and novels to contemporary historical
  documents, acclaimed historian Enda Delaney here offers a reinterpretation of Ireland''s
  encounter with modernity that corrects these stereotypes. By situating the island''s
  history between 1780 and 1916 within its broader European, global, and colonial
  contexts, he demonstrates that Ireland''s pathway to modernity was not inevitable,
  belated, or uni-directional: over a complex and centuries-long process it was made
  modern, and in its own distinctive way. This was related to, but distinct from,
  Ireland''s complicated colonial relationship with Britain, and played out in the
  broader contexts of globalisation and the rise of capitalism. And at the heart of
  this history are the Irish people themselves, both those who lived on the island
  and the millions of those who left during this period and made their lives in Britain,
  America, Australia, and beyond, who made sense of modernity in a variety of conflicting
  ways and, in so doing, sought to shape their own destinies and adapt the ''old''
  ways of doing things in the face of relentless waves of ''progress''. Changes in
  values, consciousness, and beliefs interacted with broader social, political, and
  cultural revolutions to create a distinctive experience of becoming modern.The result
  is a bold and wide-ranging new history of modern Ireland that restores agency to
  those who lived and made its history, raising important and timely questions about
  modernity, globalisation, modern history, and post-colonialism.'
