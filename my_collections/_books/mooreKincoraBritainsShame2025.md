abstract: "For over four decades the story of the extraordinary evil that occurred\
  \ at the Kincora Boys\u2019 Home in East Belfast in the 1970s and the shocking attempts\
  \ by MI5 to cover it up have haunted our political and social terrain for decades.\
  \ Award-winning former BBC journalist Chris Moore has been working on the story\
  \ since it first emerged in 1980, and has uncovered a horrific catalogue of failed\
  \ opportunities to put an end to the sadistic activities of the men who were running\
  \ the home, in particular those of prominent Orangeman and MI5 source William McGrath.What\
  \ has emerged over the course of Moore\u2019s investigation, in which he has gained\
  \ exclusive access to witnesses, secret documents and whistleblowers within the\
  \ British intelligence services, is that not only were the boys in Kincora systematically\
  \ sexually abused, but that some were forced into a countrywide paedophile ring,\
  \ whose members included Lord Louis Mountbatten. Moore also exposes MI5\u2019s attempts\
  \ to cover up what actually happened and that the organisation knew as early as\
  \ the 1970s that the boys in Kincora were being abused.Kincora is a shocking expos\xE9\
  \ of how the British state failed to protect some of its most vulnerable members."
