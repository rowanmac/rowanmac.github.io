abstract: From remote islands to sunken lands, Gareth Roddy traces how travel writing
  and tourism shaped the cultural and political imagination of the British and Irish
  West between 1880 and 1940. The west has long gripped the imagination. In Atlantic
  Isles, Gareth Roddy examines the cultural and political prominence of the "westward
  gaze," which flourished in late-nineteenth century Britain and Ireland. From Cornish
  cliffs and Welsh mountains to Hebridean islands and the Connemara highlands, the
  west was an imagined geography that transcended the national territories of these
  isles. In the west, geologists uncovered ancient layers of rock, ethnologists described
  older racial "types," philologists looked for the survival of Celtic languages,
  and antiquarians and archaeologists marveled at megalithic monuments at the Atlantic
  coastline.  This book draws on wide-ranging contemporary sources, including works
  of geology, philology, ethnology, history, geography, archaeology, folklore, literature,
  sociology, and an extensive collection of travel writing that popularized western
  landscapes among readers and tourists who explored the increasingly accessible west
  by road, rail, and steamer. Atlantic Isles reveals that western landscapes were
  especially powerful spaces of modern enchantment, where stories of sunken lands
  and mythical islands produced a sense of mystery and wonder in a supposedly disenchanted
  world. The significance of western landscapes for national identities is well known,
  but this book demonstrates that the west was also central to debates about Britishness
  and to the bold attempt to construct a narrative of multinational union that claimed
  deep historical roots at a time when the subject of Home Rule periodically dominated
  political debate.
