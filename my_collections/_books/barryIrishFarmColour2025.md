abstract: "For generations the Irish farm has been a way of life, anchoring communities,\
  \ shaping traditions and instilling values passed down through the furrows of time.\
  \ Rooted in fertile soil and a favourable climate, Ireland\u2019s farming heritage\
  \ runs deep, tied to the rhythm of the seasons and the enduring bond between farmers\
  \ and the land.In this richly illustrated book, the bestselling duo of Michael B.\
  \ Barry and John O\u2019Byrne bring the story of the Irish farm vividly to life,\
  \ from the late nineteenth century to the close of the twentieth. Through over 200\
  \ colourised photographs, the book captures the hardship and the humour, and the\
  \ toil and the togetherness of life on the land.A heartfelt celebration of the Irish\
  \ countryside and those who shaped it is a tribute to the fields, the families and\
  \ the fierce resilience at the heart of rural Ireland."
