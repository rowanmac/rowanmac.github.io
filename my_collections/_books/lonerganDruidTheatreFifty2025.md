abstract: "This fully illustrated and authorised history marks fifty years of one\
  \ of Ireland\u2019s most ground-breaking and successful theatrical ensembles. Founded\
  \ in 1975, Druid is a touring theatre company, anchored in the West of Ireland and\
  \ looking to the world.Druid began as a bold idea: to create Ireland\u2019s first\
  \ professional theatre company outside of Dublin. There were few resources with\
  \ which to achieve such an undertaking in the West of Ireland in 1975. Through sheer\
  \ dedication, and with the support of the Galway community, founders Garry Hynes,\
  \ Marie Mullen and Mick Lally \u2013 alongside a protean ensemble of actors, crew\
  \ and supporters \u2013 made this bold idea a reality. That reality has since become\
  \ an international success story of extraordinary dimensions.In this comprehensive\
  \ history of the company, Patrick Lonergan weaves together decades of personal stories,\
  \ archival material, anecdotes, memories and performances into a fascinating and\
  \ illuminating portrait of one of the most vital institutions in Ireland\u2019s\
  \ theatrical landscape."
