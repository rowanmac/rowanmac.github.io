abstract: "Examines common themes and connections in Gaelic storytelling from the\
  \ Middle Ages to present day. From the great medieval saga T\xE1in B\xF3 C\xFAailnge\
  \ to cautionary folk tales in contemporary Gaeltacht areas, storytelling has remained\
  \ a cornerstone of Gaelic culture for over a thousand years. Pre-Christian motifs\
  \ and ecclesiastical influences, with nods to classical literature and poetic devices,\
  \ provide the framework for many stories that remain familiar today (such as St\
  \ Patrick's journey across Ireland and the exploits of Finn mac Cumhaill). However,\
  \ despite this rich tradition, scholarship on Gaelic storytelling that crosses both\
  \ medieval and modern fields is a rarity; as a result, there is a question mark\
  \ over what of the early tradition remains in the modern, and what this can tell\
  \ us about the ecology and the survival of Gaelic storytelling. This volume presents\
  \ ground-breaking research from scholars in both areas, providing a dynamic insight\
  \ into the refractions of Gaelic storytelling across a broad chronological period.\
  \ Contributors address matters such as composition, style, narrative techniques,\
  \ audience, and the importance of physical and social landscapes, drawing on a variety\
  \ of methodologies, including philological, narratological, comparative literature,\
  \ folkloristic, and translation studies. From seminal research on notions of sc\xE9\
  l \"story\" and truth to an exploration of the issues facing a Gaelic translator\
  \ today, these essays work together to widen and deepen our understanding of how\
  \ and why stories were so fundamental - and remain so fundamental - to Gaelic culture."
