abstract: "This volume presents a rich variety of new scholarly explorations of life\
  \ in medieval Dublin, including an analysis by Bruce Campbell of the occupational\
  \ profile of medieval Dubliners as revealed by records such as the famous Guild\
  \ Merchant Roll; we also present Valentin Rothaupt's analytical comparison of the\
  \ spectrum of occupations and the influence of guilds in Dublin with those of Gaffeln\
  \ in the German city of Cologne; Peter Crooks calls attention to the huge collection\
  \ of Latin deeds surviving from the medieval city and their enormous historical\
  \ value, while Sarah Hendriks discusses the records of Dublin's late medieval guild\
  \ of carpenters. The book also contains an examination by Patrick Wadden of Richard\
  \ Stanihurst's famous claim that Oxmantown began life in the year 1095 following\
  \ an invasion of Dublin by ' Easterlings'; Caitlin Ellis explores links between\
  \ Dublin and the medieval earldom of Orkney in the era of the battle of Clontarf;\
  \ Denis Casey offers a critical re-examination of the story of the elaborate feast\
  \ held at Dublin by King Henry II at Christmas 1171; Shea Brennan discusses the\
  \ famous triennial ceremonial procession through the suburbs of the city, known\
  \ as the ' Riding of the Franchises'; while the volume also hosts Bernadette Williams's\
  \ evaluation of how the Dublin chronicler John de Pembridge chose to portray contemporary\
  \ English kings and their lieutenants in Ireland. Major archaeological excavations\
  \ have been conducted by Edmond O' Donovan at the site of the great St Mary's Cistercian\
  \ Abbey and this volume contains his preliminary report, along with the results\
  \ of Paul Duffy's dig nearby at the abbey's ' Cemetary Gate' and outer precinct\
  \ wall. Franc Myles also presents results from his excavation at Keysars Lane beside\
  \ St Audoen' s; Caitr\xED ona Moore discusses her excavation of a riverfront site\
  \ at Strand Street Great and Abbey Street Upper; while Muireann N\xED Cheallach\xE1\
  \ in describes the contents of a medieval dumping ground she found at Chancery Street\
  \ in Oxmantown. Artefactual studies include John Nicholl's report on an important\
  \ assemblage of shoes and other leatherwork dating from the late tenth century onwards,\
  \ excavated at Strand Street Great."
