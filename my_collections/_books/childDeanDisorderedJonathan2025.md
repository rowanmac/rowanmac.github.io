abstract: Understanding Jonathan Swift's medical and literary life   The Dean Disordered
  bridges biography and literary criticism to examine the chronic afflictions suffered
  by the great Irish satirist Jonathan Swift, investigating not only how these ailments
  affected his day-to-day social life and ambitions but also how he represented them
  in his correspondence and imaginative writings. By historicizing Swift's medical
  issues, Paul William Child returns the creator of the iconic character of Gulliver
  (a surgeon, notably) to the humoral body that he knew. Child situates Swift's complaints
  within the theory of illness as an imbalance of fluid humors that had persisted
  since classical days, considering how Swift tried to make sense of and contain his
  own humors through narrative explanation, medical interventions and regimen, performances
  in the 'sick role,' and imaginative representations. Rather than accepting modern
  diagnoses of Swift's illnesses, The Dean Disordered reconstructs the medical culture
  of his time. The book opens a window into Swift's experience of illness and prompts
  us to read both the man and his works anew.
