abstract: "The 1920s London-Irish Theatre: A History documents, explores and interrogates\
  \ the Irish theatre that was prevalent in London during the 1920s. This includes\
  \ consideration of the movements that impacted 1920s London theatre, such as the\
  \ influential repertory theatres of the first decade of the twentieth century, as\
  \ well as the detailed history of the Irish Players. Each identified London-Irish\
  \ production is discussed through contemporary theatre reviews from London newspapers\
  \ and journals, and within the decade\u2019s historical context. Dramatists, their\
  \ plays, actors, producers, and the physical theatres are all considered as extensively\
  \ as evidence allows. Major productions, like those of Lennox Robinson\u2019s The\
  \ White-Headed Boy, Sean O\u2019Casey\u2019s Juno and the Paycock, and Bernard Shaw\u2019\
  s Saint Joan with its distinct Irish echoes are considered, along with productions\
  \ of George Shiels\u2019 Professor Tim and Bernard Duffy\u2019s The Counter Charm\
  \ and more. Producers discussed include James Fagan and Charles Macdona, while considered\
  \ actors include Sara Allgood, Maire O\u2019Neill, Arthur Sinclair, Fred O\u2019\
  Donovan, Ellen O\u2019Malley, Ethel O\u2019Shea, and many more. This leads, for\
  \ the first time, to a full portrait of the Irish theatre that was produced in London\
  \ during the 1920s in not only the West End, but also in smaller London theatres\
  \ and in suburban repertory theatres."
