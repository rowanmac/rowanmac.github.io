abstract: "Kilwaughter \u2013 The Unknown Castle: Four Centuries of Power, Politics,\
  \ and DeclineOn the edge of Larne in County Antrim, the crumbling remains of Kilwaughter\
  \ Castle whisper of a forgotten past. Once a proud plantation house, it has borne\
  \ silent witness to centuries of conquest, ambition, scandal, and resilience.From\
  \ the ancient \xD3 Gn\xEDmh bards\u2014later Anglicised to Agnew\u2014through Anglo-Norman\
  \ lords, Scottish settlers, and Italian aristocrats, this richly researched narrative\
  \ traces the turbulent journey of a single estate and the extraordinary lives entwined\
  \ with it. Meet figures who helped shape Belfast, men embroiled in politics and\
  \ rebellion, profiteers of the West Indies slave trade, and a determined American\
  \ woman who sought to rescue the castle from oblivion.Through war, abandonment,\
  \ and faded glory, Kilwaughter \u2013 The Unknown Castle brings to life the rise\
  \ and fall of families, the clash of empires, and the enduring legacy of a remarkable\
  \ structure. For readers of historical biography, social history, and architectural\
  \ heritage, this is a vivid portrait of one forgotten corner of Northern Ireland\u2014\
  and the global currents that shaped it."
