abstract: "Throughout the Twentieth Century many women in Ireland and Britain endured\
  \ shame and institutionalisation for becoming pregnant outside of marriage. In this\
  \ welcome study, Lorraine Grimes examines the journeys made by hundreds of pregnant\
  \ Irish women to Britain as they fled to escape their local communities.Their experiences\
  \ in Britain, however, were not free of stigma and Grimes\u2019s book analyses the\
  \ nuances of the institutional networks both in Britain and Ireland which these\
  \ women utilised.Single Mothers in Twentieth Century Ireland and Britain focuses\
  \ on the experiences of women from 1926-1973 in cities with high Irish emigrant\
  \ populations, including London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Glasgow. Unlike official\
  \ narratives such as Ireland\u2019s Commission of Investigation into the Mother\
  \ and Baby Homes, this book prioritises the experiences of the survivors and ensure\
  \ that women\u2019s experiences are central to the narrative. It also incorporates\
  \ original interviews with children born in institutions and for the first time,\
  \ interviews with religious and medical staff are also included in the historiography.Using\
  \ archival research and oral history, Grimes reveals the methods British and Irish\
  \ institutions developed, from forced adoption to repatriation and the impacts of\
  \ this on the women and children\u2019s lives. Grimes makes a significant contribution\
  \ to the historiography surrounding the movement of women and children across international\
  \ borders through repatriation and adoption between institutions on both sides of\
  \ the Irish Sea. From extensive archival research, this book reveals cases of Irish\
  \ single mothers seeking assistance in Britain as well as cases of rape, incest\
  \ and domestic violence within the institutional records. In addition, archival\
  \ cases expose prejudice towards women from other colonial countries in institutions\
  \ in Britain, particularly from the 1960s. A first for the field, Single Mothers\
  \ includes a chapter on the experiences of single fathers. Sensitive to the underlying\
  \ issues of class and gender politics, the book also shows that women often enacted\
  \ a large degree of agency to improve their situation.If you are interested in women\u2019\
  s political and social history, and the history of the institutional relationships\
  \ of Britain and Ireland, this book is essential reading."
