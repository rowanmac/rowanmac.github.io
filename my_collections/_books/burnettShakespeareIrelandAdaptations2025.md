abstract: "Through a selection of essays from a variety of scholarly voices, this\
  \ volume maps the various ways in which Shakespeare has been adapted, adopted and\
  \ appropriated in Ireland from the late 17th century through to the present day.\
  \ Shakespeare's plays have been performed in Ireland since the 1660s, when Smock\
  \ Alley theatre was established in Dublin, with Shakespeare serving as its essential\
  \ stock-in-trade. Since then the playwright's work has played a central role in\
  \ the formation of Irish culture. His works helped to fashion colonial identity\
  \ in Ireland in the 18th century and beyond, but, from the 1800s onwards, Shakespeare\
  \ also became an important figure for Irish nationalists.In the modern period, Shakespeare\u2019\
  s influence can also be discerned in the work of a broad range of Irish writers,\
  \ and this volume considers the impact of his plays on such authors as Synge, Joyce,\
  \ Beckett and others. The volume also explores the place of Shakespeare in the Irish\
  \ theatrical tradition.Shakespeare in Ireland explores the history of Irish Shakespeare\
  \ through the numerous ways in which the playwright and his work were reconfigured\
  \ and recycled in various Irish contexts. The volume demonstrates how Shakespeare\
  \ has been rendered Irish in a variety of complex ways, and it aims to track, over\
  \ time, the story of how Shakespeare became a fully hibernicised figure."
