abstract: "Celebrated in song by Christy Moore and affectionately recalled in many\
  \ memoirs, Robert \"Bob\" Hilliard, the author's grandfather, is one of Ireland's\
  \ best-known International Brigadistas. His short life blazed with a rare intensity;\
  \ his death in Spain left a dark shadow hanging over his family. This book unravels\
  \ Hilliard\u2019s enigmas to bring us an absorbing character and a fresh understanding\
  \ of the times that shaped him.\_Hilliard was radicalised at school by the Irish\
  \ revolution. Variously a journalist, an Olympic boxer for Ireland and a Church\
  \ of Ireland priest, he became a communist and anti-fascist in London, fought with\
  \ the International Brigades in\_the Spanish Civil War and died of wounds sustained\
  \ at the Battle of Jarama. Eloquent and colourful, he inspires puzzlement as well\
  \ as admiration. Why was his life so full of contradictions? One question haunted\
  \ the author's mother: how could he leave his children? Lin Rose Clark sets out\
  \ to find answers.\_Through meticulous research and a deeply personal exploration\
  \ of her family's past, she brings together an engrossing picture of the man and\
  \ a tale of flawed romance, passionate commitment and war, portraying Hilliard as\
  \ part of a turbulent history that still reverberates today."
