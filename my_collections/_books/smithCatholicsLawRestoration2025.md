abstract: In 1660 Charles II was restored to the thrones of England, Scotland and
  Ireland, but his hold on power was precarious. In particular, Ireland was fundamentally
  unstable - Catholics formed the majority of the population in a country where Protestantism
  was the established religion, a state of affairs unique in Europe. It was through
  the law that the restored Stuart monarchy governed its subjects and its colonial
  dependencies, and this book examines how Catholics engaged with and experienced
  English common law primarily through the eyes of Catholic clerics and Gaelic poets.
  It also examines how Catholics engaged with the Courts and the particular challenges
  they faced as lawyers. The book draws on an extensive body of primary source materials,
  including Irish-language poetry and little-used archival material relating to elite
  Catholic families.
