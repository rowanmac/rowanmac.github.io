abstract: "Ireland\u2019s accession to the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1973\
  \ provided great opportunities, as well as significant challenges to its relatively\
  \ small civil service. This book traces Ireland\u2019s internal adaptation to managing\
  \ membership. The long wait for accession to the EEC had instigated administrative\
  \ and management patterns during negotiations which were difficult for Ireland to\
  \ untangle and alter afterwards. There was friction between departments on how to\
  \ approach relations with the EEC in some policy areas after membership. At times,\
  \ this effectively slowed and even hampered Ireland\u2019s adaptation to membership.\
  \ At the same time, the EEC provided an important new frame of reference for Irish\
  \ society. Discussions on social progress drew from that wider context and challenged\
  \ Ireland in new ways. This volume explores this development through an analysis\
  \ of empirical files from the National Archives of Ireland and the Historical Archives\
  \ of the European Union, newspapers, and secondary sources.This book is intended\
  \ for scholars and students of Irish history, European Studies, political science,\
  \ diplomatic studies, and administrative history."
