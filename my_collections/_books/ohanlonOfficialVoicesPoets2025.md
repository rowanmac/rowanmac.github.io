abstract: "Official Voices: Poets and the Irish State examines the poet-politicians\
  \ and bureaucrats who shaped the twenty-six-county Irish state, from its pre-history\
  \ in the revolutionary period through its foundation in 1922 and complicated modernisation\
  \ in the 1960s to the outbreak of the Troubles. Poet-officials juggled writing the\
  \ state and navigating the force-field between poetry and politics, with poetic\
  \ form registering the aftershocks of this collusive antagonism. Combining political\
  \ history, cultural history and literary criticism, the book grapples with major\
  \ issues in the state\u2019s history: revolution, state violence/insurgency against\
  \ the state, patriarchy, partition, modernisation, as well as socialist and feminist\
  \ alternatives to conservative nationalism. Poets examined in the book include W.B.\
  \ Yeats, Ezra Pound, Desmond FitzGerald, Denis Devlin, Joseph Campbell, Valentin\
  \ Iremonger, Eithne Strong, M\xE1ire Mhac an tSaoi and Thomas Kinsella. It draws\
  \ on new archival work in state archives and literary collections, and situates\
  \ the Irish state and Irish poetry within a transnational frame. Taking up the relationship\
  \ of poetry to politics, and poet-officials to state governance, it tackles a perennial\
  \ question: what did poetry make happen (and not happen) in the twenty-six counties?\
  \ This book is about acknowledged legislators, poetry\u2019s formal vigilance, and\
  \ how poets apprehended, consciously and unconsciously, the recalcitrant workings\
  \ of power."
