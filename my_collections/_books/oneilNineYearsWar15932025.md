abstract: The Nine Years War (1593-1603), sometimes known as Tyrone's Rebellion, was
  one of the most devastating and brutal conflicts to sweep the island. Never would
  the English Crown come so close to losing its grip on Ireland. It was brought on
  by a combination of English misrule, Irish ambition and the fortuitous creation
  of political ties with Spain. A confederation of Irish lords led by the charismatic
  and exceptionally gifted Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone, swept from one victory to
  another. Part 1 of this series will examine the years of Irish triumph as English
  nonchalance turned to disbelief and then panic as Irish armies engaged with and
  defeated all attempts by the Crown to restore English authority.Tyrone duped the
  English state into believing it was engaged in a local affair against Hugh Maguire,
  lord of Fermanagh, for the first two years of the war. While the English fought
  a shooting war in the west of Ulster, Tyrone raised an unprecedented confederation
  of Irish lords that set aside parochial self-interest to mount a concerted and coordinated
  effort to eject English power from Ireland once and for all.Time and again, English
  armies were engaged and defeated by modernised Irish forces fighting with a skill
  and technical sophistication never before seen. This series of Crown defeats came
  to a bloody climax at the battle of the Yellow Ford on 14 August 1598. The Irish
  shattered the English field army in a matter of hours. Its commander, Henry Bagenal,
  was killed along with almost half his men. The battle remains the greatest defeat
  given to the English by Irish arms and a striking reverse to a period often seen
  as Elizabeth's Golden Age.
