abstract: "A new history of the Celts that reveals how this once-forgotten people\
  \ became a pillar of modern national identity in Britain, Ireland, and FranceBefore\
  \ the Greeks and Romans, the Celts ruled the ancient world. They sacked Rome, invaded\
  \ Greece, and conquered much of Europe, from Ireland to Turkey. Celts registered\
  \ deeply on the classical imagination for a thousand years and were variously described\
  \ by writers like Caesar and Livy as unruly barbarians, fearless warriors, and gracious\
  \ hosts. But then, in the early Middle Ages, they vanished. In The Celts, Ian Stewart\
  \ tells the story of their rediscovery during the Renaissance and their transformation\
  \ over the next few centuries into one of the most popular European ancestral peoples.The\
  \ Celts shows how the idea of this ancient people was recovered by scholars, honed\
  \ by intellectuals, politicians, and other thinkers of various stripes, and adopted\
  \ by cultural revivalists and activists as they tried to build European nations\
  \ and nationalisms during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Long-forgotten,\
  \ the Celts improbably came to be seen as the ancestors of most western Europeans\u2014\
  and as a pillar of modern national identity in Britain, Ireland, and France.Based\
  \ on new research conducted across Europe and in the United States, The Celts reveals\
  \ when and how we came to call much of Europe \u201CCeltic,\u201D why this idea\
  \ mattered in the past, and why it still matters today, as the tide of nationalism\
  \ is once again on the rise."
