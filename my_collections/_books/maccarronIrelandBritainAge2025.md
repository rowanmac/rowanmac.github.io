abstract: This volume comprises the first eight lectures (2017-2024) presented in
  memory of Jennifer O'Reilly, a renowned expert in early medieval Insular culture.
  The Memorial Lecture Series was established in 2017 by the School of History, University
  College Cork, where Dr O'Reilly spent most of her career. Each year a distinguished
  scholar is invited to speak on either the writings of Bede (c. 673-735) or medieval
  iconography, two subjects that Dr O'Reilly explored in her research and teaching.
  The studies in this volume, which are varied in subject matter and approach, indicating
  the breadth and depth of the honorand's scholarship, offer ground-breaking insights
  into early medieval Insular culture. The contents illuminate our understanding of
  relations between the islands of Britain and Ireland during the Age of Bede. Analyses
  of the writings of Bede, situate his work in the context of his patristic inheritance
  and his monastic community of Wearmouth and Jarrow, thereby advancing our knowledge
  of that influential monastery. New approaches to medieval art and iconography highlight
  the importance of specific imagery in Insular culture and re-examine one of the
  most iconic examples of Insular art, the high cross. This book will be of value
  to anyone interested in early medieval Ireland and Britain, especially those who
  wish to learn more about cross-cultural connections between these islands, and the
  interpretation of Scripture in Insular culture.
