abstract: "Working-Class Women in Irish Literature and Theatre critically engages\
  \ with works of theatre both by and about working-class women, historically and\
  \ presently. Addressing professional and community theatre productions, from both\
  \ textual and performative perspectives, this volume focuses on works of theatre\
  \ by practitioners, directors, playwrights, and performance artists across rural\
  \ and urban contexts. Irish theatre has a long history of signifying social class.\
  \ Yet the representations of working-class women in Irish theatrical history also\
  \ encompass several problematic issues, starting with the fact that these depictions\
  \ were created by male writers like J. M Synge and Se\xE1n O'Casey to name but a\
  \ few. Nonetheless, the theatre\u2019s emphasis on embodied performance and its\
  \ ability to reach its public in an unmediated way has attracted working-class engagement\
  \ perhaps more than other art forms in Ireland. Contemporary playwrights in the\
  \ Republic and the north of Ireland have tirelessly striven to illuminate working-class\
  \ women\u2019s lived experiences and have reframed the characterisation of working-class\
  \ women by drawing out the intersection of social class with sexualities, ethnic\
  \ minorities, and racial identities. This edited collection also includes the voices\
  \ of directors, playwrights, and performers who identify with a working-class social\
  \ background, offering first-hand accounts of their lived experience in the theatre\
  \ industry."
