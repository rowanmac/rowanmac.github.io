abstract: "In May 1922, James Craig described the Boundary Commission as the \u2018\
  root of all evil\u2019 for Ulster unionists. Conversely, it ultimately bolstered\
  \ the unionist cause, leaving the border unchanged and abandoning swathes of Northern\
  \ nationalists who had assumed that large tracts of land would be transferred to\
  \ the Free State. Offered to Sinn F\xE9in plenipotentiaries during the 1921 Treaty\
  \ negotiations, the Boundary Commission was viewed as a major concession by David\
  \ Lloyd George, but the vague wording of the clause agreed to by the Irish delegation\
  \ would prove disastrous. Delayed by the civil war and Unionist non-cooperation,\
  \ the Boundary Commission finally convened in 1924, hampered from the get-go by\
  \ Sinn F\xE9in\u2019s naivety, the intransigence of Ulster unionists and the duplicity\
  \ of successive British governments. It disbanded less than a year later without\
  \ an inch gained for the twenty-six counties. After 1925, the nationalist community\
  \ in the North had to accept that \u2018whether they liked it or not, that they\
  \ were citizens of Northern Ireland\u2019, their trust in both British and Free\
  \ State governments irrevocably damaged. One hundred years on, Cormac Moore illuminates\
  \ the fascinating and infuriating story behind the Boundary Commission\u2019s momentous\
  \ failure."
