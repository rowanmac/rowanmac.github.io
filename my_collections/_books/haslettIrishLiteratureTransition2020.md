abstract: This volume examines eighteenth-century Irish literature, highlighting the
  diversity of texts, authors and approaches that characterises contemporary studies
  of the period. Chapters consider the contexts of history, politics, language, philosophy,
  gender, sexuality, and the environment while situating Irish literature in relation
  to Ireland, Britain, Europe and beyond. Well-known authors (Jonathan Swift, Edmund
  Burke and Oliver Goldsmith) are read alongside less familiar writers (including
  Mary Barber, William Chaigneau, Frances Sheridan, and Samuel Whyte) and popular
  and ephemeral literatures take their place with formerly canonical texts. It demonstrates
  the exciting vitality and richness of eighteenth-century Irish literature - written
  and performed - as well as its complex intersections with different communities
  and traditions. This book will be a key resource to scholars and students of Irish
  eighteenth-century studies as well as readers generally interested in questions
  of Anglophone and Irish-language culture, representations of gender and sexuality,
  and national and trans-national identities.
