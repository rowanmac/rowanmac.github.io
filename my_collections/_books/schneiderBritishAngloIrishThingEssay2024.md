abstractNote: "While the it-narrative, the thing-poem and thing theatre have been\
  \ around for some time, the essay \u2013 which is often considered literature\u2019\
  s fourth genre \u2013 is still lacking its thing-subgenre. Yet, particularly British\
  \ and Anglo-Irish literature display a long, albeit so far implicit tradition of\
  \ texts that can be categorised as \u2018thing-essays\u2019: Starting with Jonathan\
  \ Swift\u2019s \u201CMeditation upon a Broomstick\u201D (1701) and continuing until\
  \ today, these texts draw broader insights from the contemplation of a material\
  \ item of daily life. This book provides the first theoretical conceptualisation\
  \ of this genre. Bringing elements from essay studies and the New Materialisms together,\
  \ it shows why the essay lends itself particularly well to literarisations of the\
  \ personal relationships that people foster to everyday objects. While the idiosyncrasies\
  \ of each essay show the versatility of thing-essays, the study also seeks to unearth\
  \ changing attitudes towards things \u2013 and thus towards people\u2019s material\
  \ surroundings in general \u2013 throughout time. In order to account for such synchronic\
  \ and diachronic differences in thing-essays, this study develops a typology of\
  \ three modes via which things can be approached essayistically. In the book\u2019\
  s second part, this framework will be employed in close readings and historicisations\
  \ of 14 thing-essays from 1701 until 2021. Ranging from satire to sentimental writing,\
  \ from religion to consumerism, from class to gender differences, from feelings\
  \ of nationality to exoticism, from the French Revolution to Freud and from art\
  \ to everyday life, the stylistic and thematic broadness of these thing-essays ultimately\
  \ shows the multifarious connections between human life and materiality."
