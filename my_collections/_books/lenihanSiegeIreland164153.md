abstract: "Siege was the defining experience of the grindingly brutal and consequential\
  \ Irish Wars of Religion (1641- 53). Civilians were more likely to encounter siege\
  \ warfare as participants and as victims than any other kind of military action.\
  \ P\xE1 draig Lenihan, an acknowledged expert on the period, conveys this experience\
  \ by examining survivor testimony contained in the 1641 Depositions, the largest\
  \ and most diverse body of direct and vivid accounts of the civilian exposure to\
  \ war in the early modern period. Giving equal weight to the ' sharp end' of warfare\
  \ and to ' war and society' issues such as recruitment, logistics and strategy,\
  \ the author borrows and adapts methodologies from social and cultural history in\
  \ order to understand how societies experience conflict and give meaning to it.\
  \ These were religious wars and if all sides thought they glimpsed Heaven in the\
  \ sky above them, they' d all spent time in Hell."
