abstract: "Painting History: The Murals of Northern Ireland, 1908\u20132024 is the\
  \ first book-length study of the oldest and most enduring tradition of political\
  \ wall art. Tony Crowley shows how muralism became an important medium for the unionist\
  \ and loyalist community in its political domination of public space before and\
  \ after Partition. The text also demonstrates that nationalists and republicans\
  \ painted few murals before the start of the 1981 Hunger Strike, during which they\
  \ painted wall art across republican areas of Northern Ireland as a way of publicizing\
  \ their cause. In the context of a divided society, by the mid 1980s murals had\
  \ become an established genre for the expression of political demands and aspirations.\
  \ In Painting History, Tony Crowley provides a detailed analysis of the complex\
  \ tradition of muralism in the context of the history that produced it, with particular\
  \ attention given to the cultural politics of this remarkable form. The book also\
  \ raises and discusses a series of theoretical questions about murals and muralism\
  \ that transcend Northern Ireland: issues of propriety and legality, form and content,\
  \ authority and censorship. The work ends with a consideration of the future of\
  \ the murals in a still polarized but changing region."
