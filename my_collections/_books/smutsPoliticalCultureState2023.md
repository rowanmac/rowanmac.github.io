abstract: "Abstract\n            This book examines how the strategic problem of containing\
  \ threats of religious war and violence shaped political culture and the development\
  \ of the state in Britain and Ireland between Elizabeth I\u2019s last serious courtship\
  \ and the death of James VI and I. In doing so it shows how the religious politics\
  \ of England, Scotland, and Ireland were thoroughly intertwined with each other,\
  \ and with developments on the European Continent, requiring a treatment that moves\
  \ beyond a framework of national history by connecting events in different countries\
  \ in a continuous narrative. Specific topics covered include the interaction of\
  \ religious and dynastic politics not only in relations between royal families but\
  \ also among the nobility and gentry; efforts by the Elizabethan state to contain\
  \ threats of Catholic rebellions; the often fraught relations between the Elizabethan\
  \ regime and James VI in Scotland; cultural attitudes related to military entrepreneurship\
  \ on both land and sea; challenges to Protestant state power in Ireland; English\
  \ intervention in the wars of the Netherlands; the interplay between English and\
  \ Scottish conflicts over Presbyterianism in the 1590s; efforts to create a more\
  \ integrated and effective state encompassing all of Britain and Ireland after 1603;\
  \ and the European policies of James VI and I."
