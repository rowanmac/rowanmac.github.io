abstract: "Assessing the impact of paramilitary violence on border Protestants in\
  \ Northern Ireland remains a critically overlooked part of the region\u2019s history.\
  \ Remembered through a framework of memory that blurs the boundary between victim\
  \ and perpetrator, existing scholarship often disempowers border Protestants by\
  \ obscuring their experience under the Provisional IRA\u2019s campaign. This re-examination\
  \ of the conflict illuminates how the Troubles impacted the Protestant community\u2019\
  s physical, economic, and cultural presence in the border counties. Combining oral\
  \ history with a broader assessment of the Provisional campaign, this book presents\
  \ a compelling case study for viewing this violence as a form of ethnic cleansing."
