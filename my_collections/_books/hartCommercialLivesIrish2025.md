abstract: "This book examines Irish women\u2019s lives in the nineteenth and early\
  \ twentieth centuries from a new angle, investigating how they inherited, bought,\
  \ or started up businesses. Some guided their operations to impressive profit and\
  \ growth, while others coped with devastating failure. The many and varied primary\
  \ sources which inform Antonia Hart\u2019s research place all these businesswomen\
  \ in public-facing roles, in commercial environments, making economic decisions\
  \ and operating with autonomy which they sought out and claimed. These were not\
  \ unusual women. They were present in the main streets of towns and cities, their\
  \ businesses both visible and unsurprising to passers-by.Women\u2019s businesses\
  \ mattered. They enabled employees, both women and men, to earn their livings. They\
  \ paid fees for professional services to accounting and legal firms. They contributed\
  \ to the local and national economies. They provided training, and sometimes accommodation,\
  \ for apprentices. Women\u2019s businesses mattered in the credit economy, not only\
  \ in their extension of credit for goods and services, but also in the form of collateralised\
  \ loans, from the pawnbroker\u2019s counter, while the Dublin pawnbrokers also contributed\
  \ an annual sum to the city policing budget.In the context of well-ventilated ideas\
  \ about what a woman should be, many girls grew up seeing their teachers, mothers,\
  \ sisters, and neighbours bring pragmatism and creativity into commercial lives.\
  \ This book shows how private realities diverged from public ideals, and describes\
  \ for the first time a robust and intriguing national heritage of Irish female entrepreneurship."
