abstract: 'Solidarity and Pressure is the first full-length study of the Irish Anti-Apartheid
  Movement (IAAM). Founded in April 1964, the IAAM spearheaded fundraising efforts,
  organized events, lobbied Irish politicians, and actively promoted the struggle
  against Apartheid South Africa across local, international, political, and cultural
  spheres. Despite its modest size, Ireland''s movement was ranked by the African
  National Congress as one of the strongest in terms of solidarity, alongside the
  Dutch and Scandinavian movements.Drawing on seventy interviews, the IAAM''s own
  records, and private papers from Anti-Apartheid activists, Solidarity and Pressure
  captures the exhilarating story of the IAAM across three decades: how it thrived
  in Ireland due to the historical context of national liberation, along with the
  opposition it faced in the Cold War era. It charts the birth of the movement, its
  engagement with southern Africa, overlaps with the conflict in Northern Ireland,
  the opposition it faced from authorities in Ireland and South Africa, the Dunnes
  Stores strike (1984-87), its relationship with Irish political parties and governments,
  and its advocacy for sporting and cultural boycotts. The book assesses the contribution
  of the IAAM''s enigmatic founder Kader Asmal (1934-2011), and his co-founder and
  wife, Louise Asmal, who championed the ANC''s strategy of forging broad political
  coalitions, successfully drawing in members from all Irish political parties to
  advance the Anti-Apartheid struggle.'
