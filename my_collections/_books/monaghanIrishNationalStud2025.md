abstract: "This book examines the history of a pioneering Thoroughbred horse breeding\
  \ operation, the Irish National Stud. By incorporating and integrating a diverse\
  \ array of primary sources from various repositories and supplementing them with\
  \ contemporary and secondary materials, the main narrative reveals the intricate\
  \ details of Ireland\u2019s complex relationship with Britain through sport and\
  \ politics. The publication adopts a chronological, thematic approach, beginning\
  \ at the turn of the nineteenth century and tracing the development of the Stud\
  \ through the twentieth century and into the twenty-first century.This book encompasses\
  \ the political, cultural, and social dimensions of horse breeding/racing and the\
  \ role of what would become the Irish National Stud. The first period of its history\
  \ covers the establishment of Tully Stud in Kildare under Colonel William Hall-Walker\
  \ in 1900. The second period, from 1916 to 1944, begins with Hall-Walker \u2018\
  gifting\u2019 Tully Stud to the British government, which then rebranded it as the\
  \ \u2018National Stud\u2019. This coincided with the Irish independence struggle\
  \ and the formation of the new Irish Free State, leading to over two decades of\
  \ deadlock over which government\u2014Irish or British\u2014legally owned the Stud.\
  \ The third period saw the progression of the new Irish National Stud, from its\
  \ creation in 1944 to the present day, offering a comparison with the British National\
  \ Stud and providing a thorough analysis of the influence of elite Thoroughbred\
  \ breeders on the Irish National Stud and the broader industry in both Ireland and\
  \ Great Britain."
