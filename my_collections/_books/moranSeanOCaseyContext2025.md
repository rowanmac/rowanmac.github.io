abstract: Sean O'Casey is one of Ireland's best-known writers. He is the most frequently
  performed playwright in the history of the Irish National Theatre, and his work
  is often revived onstage elsewhere. O'Casey is also widely studied in schools, colleges,
  and universities in the English-speaking world. This book offers a new contextualisation
  of this famous writer's work, revisiting his association with Irish nationalism,
  historical revisionism, and celebrated contemporaries such as W. B. Yeats and Lady
  Gregory. The volume also brings O'Casey's work into contact with topics including
  disability studies, gender and sexuality, post-colonialism, ecocriticism, and race.
  Sean O'Casey in Context explores a number of existing ideas about O'Casey in the
  light of new academic developments, and updates our understanding of this important
  writer by taking into account recent scholarly thinking and a range of theatrical
  productions from around the globe.
