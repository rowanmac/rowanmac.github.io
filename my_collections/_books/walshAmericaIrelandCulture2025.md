abstract: "While the impacts of Irish emigration to America following the Great Famine\
  \ of 1845\u20131852 have been well studied, comparatively little scholarly attention\
  \ has been paid to the effects of reverse migration on Irish culture, society, and\
  \ politics. Inspired by the work of historian David P. B. Fitzpatrick (1948\u2013\
  2019) and forming a companion to his final published work The Americanisation of\
  \ Ireland: Migration and Settlement 1841\u20131925 (Cambridge, 2019), this volume\
  \ explores the influence of America in shaping Ireland's modernisation and globalisation.\
  \ The essays use the concept of Americanisation to explore interdisciplinary themes\
  \ of material culture, marketing, religion, politics, literature, cinema, music,\
  \ and folklore. America in Ireland reveals a late nineteenth and early twentieth-century\
  \ Irish society that was more cosmopolitan than previously assumed, in which 'Returned\
  \ Yanks' brought home new-fangled notions of behaviour and activities and introduced\
  \ their families to American products, culture and speech. In doing so, this book\
  \ demonstrates the value of a transnational and global perspective for understanding\
  \ Ireland's history."
