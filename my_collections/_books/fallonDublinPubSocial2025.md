abstract: "'Here is a history of publand, yes, but here is a moment in time as well.'For\
  \ centuries, the public house has played an important role in the social and cultural\
  \ history of Dublin. As the headquarters for a major revolution, a mecca of literary\
  \ invention or a haven from work, \u2018the local\u2019 is a cornerstone of community\
  \ life and a testament to human endeavour in an ever-changing city.Beginning with\
  \ the taverns and ale houses of the 17th and 18th centuries, Donal Fallon brings\
  \ the reader on a visual journey through world renowned public houses such as the\
  \ Brazen Head, The Long Hall, Grogan\u2019s and The Palace, and on to early houses\
  \ and gay bars, spirit grocers and shebeens. As well as the establishments themselves,\
  \ the \u2018Plain People of Ireland\u2019 appear in chapters about temperance, karaoke\
  \ and snugs. Along the way, we meet patrons as diverse and famous around the capital\
  \ as Theobald Wolfe Tone, Nell McCafferty and Con Houlihan. And visitors to Dublin\
  \ are also here, as the photographer Lee Miller seeks out the city of James Joyce\
  \ and Elizabeth Taylor searches in vain for the Ladies\u2019 toilet.Drawing from\
  \ rich archival collections, The Dublin Pub includes many previously unpublished\
  \ photographs as well as testimonies from the past and present to bring the history\
  \ of the Dublin pub to vivid life."
