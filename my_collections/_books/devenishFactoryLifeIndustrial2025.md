abstract: "Industrial Yarns Ltd, a large textiles factory and one of Se\xE1 n Lemass's\
  \ flagship industrial projects, provided well-paid employment for hundreds of workers\
  \ in Bray for many years. This contextualized study, charting the rise and fall\
  \ of the company over forty years, is based largely on wide-ranging interviews conducted\
  \ with twenty-three former workers. Their stories, spanning four decades, uncover\
  \ the factory's working conditions, culture, social relationships, remuneration\
  \ schemes, industrial relations history and its close ties with the local community.\
  \ The book provides unique insights into what it was like to work in this remarkable\
  \ enterprise."
