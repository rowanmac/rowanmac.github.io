abstract: "How do borders define political, cultural and social realms, influencing\
  \ identity and community? Mind the Gap: Borders, Limits and Frontiers explores such\
  \ questions and comprises two parts; the first section compiles interdisciplinary\
  \ essays from leading scholars to critique borders in our global yet divided world.\
  \ Topics include national borders, such as the Northern Irish border, as well as\
  \ conceptual and ontological borders more generally. Border issues are similarly\
  \ key to the second part of the book, which publishes for the first time the imprisonment\
  \ memoir of Irish politician Cahir Healy (1877\u20131970), who was a leading figure\
  \ in the protest against the Partition of Ireland. His memoir offers a first-hand\
  \ account of the conditions faced by Healy and other border objectors who were illegally\
  \ imprisoned for two years on board the Argenta ship in Belfast Lough (c.1922\u2013\
  1924). This book therefore goes beyond mapping border theory; it addresses the real-life\
  \ impact of borders on those who confront them daily and is a vital read for those\
  \ interested in border studies."
