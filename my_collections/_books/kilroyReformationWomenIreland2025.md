abstract: "This book illuminates the often-overlooked story of early modern Irish\
  \ women, particularly those from the Protestant colonial community. Drawing from\
  \ aristocratic, gentry, farming, business, and trade families, these women were\
  \ shaped by the religious and intellectual currents of their time. Raised within\
  \ the Church of Ireland or the Church of England, as adults they were enriched by\
  \ European influences of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation:\_ Swiss and Dutch\
  \ Calvinism, Gallicanism, Jansenism and the spirituality of Port Royal.The book\
  \ explores how these women engaged with Renaissance Humanism, the early French Enlightenment,\
  \ and cultural discussions on topics such as pre-existence, 12th-century Arabic\
  \ culture, Judaism, and the Lurianic Kabbala. Central to their lives was Reformation\
  \ spirituality, which fostered literacy, critical thinking, and personal faith through\
  \ vernacular Bible readings and church services.Despite living in patriarchal societies\
  \ that largely relegated women to subordinate roles, these women demonstrated remarkable\
  \ resilience and intellectualism. The book highlights their struggles and triumphs,\
  \ showing how they navigated and sometimes resisted the constraints imposed on them.\
  \ By focusing on their narratives and voice, the book reveals the courage and agency\
  \ these women exhibited in shaping their own destinies and laying out their legacies.Through\
  \ detailed biographical accounts, the book restores these women to their rightful\
  \ place in history, offering a nuanced understanding of their contributions and\
  \ the broader social and religious contexts in which they lived. Researchers and\
  \ general readers with an interest in women's history, gender studies, and early\
  \ modern Irish history will find this a useful addition to those fields."
