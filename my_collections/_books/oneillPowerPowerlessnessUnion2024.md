abstractNote: 'The history of Union Ireland is typically told through its best-known
  historical events and leaders - from the 1798 Rising, the Great Famine, and the
  Irish Revolution, to Parnell and De Valera -- and as moments of sectarian division
  and high parliamentary politics. Instead, Ciaran O''Neill here makes the case for
  a broader, more inclusive, and decentred approach that emphasizes transnational
  phenomena, a settler-colonial diaspora, and minority groups on the island. Through
  the lenses of ''power'' and ''powerlessness'', he demonstrates that the received
  historiographical wisdoms suffer from several misconceptions: on the one hand they
  misconstrue the nature of power and the powerful, perpetuating historical myths
  about the ''ungovernability'' of Ireland. After securing the Union, the British
  state proceeded to govern Ireland with less and less certainty of ever persuading
  its citizens of its legitimacy. Despite all reforms and investment, there was a
  widespread sense that Ireland would never recover and be a willing partner in the
  Union. And on the other hand they take at face value the nature of the so-called
  ''powerless'', ignoring the myriad ways in which marginalized and diasporic groups
  negotiated and asserted their agency during the Union period, influencing and transforming
  the powerful centre in the process. The result is an untraditional and thought-provoking
  reappraisal of Union Ireland that raises important questions about colonialism and
  resistance - of what it means to govern and be governed, and the long-lasting legacies
  of the spaces in between.'
