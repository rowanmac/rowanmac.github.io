abstract: This book looks at the people of Meath during the turmoil of the revolutionary
  era. As politics, war and revolution intruded on daily life, some embraced the chance
  for change, risking life and livelihood for their chosen cause; others resisted
  the tide. But for most the responsibilities of work and family, getting the children
  out to school and worrying about money, were more pressing concerns. The upheaval
  of the years from 1912 to 1923, however, gradually affected the regular round of
  shopping, sport and socializing. This book looks at life in Meath as national and
  international events drew closer to home and the future looked ever more uncertain.
  While not at the centre of the fighting, the county suffered the long anxiety brought
  by terror - the terror of conscription, of the isolated killing, ambush and reprisal.
  More intense bursts of violence, such as at Ashbourne and Trim, terrified some and
  radicalized many. Meath's unique location, touching both Ulster and Dublin, produced
  local patterns of political and revolutionary involvement, while older tensions
  over land flowed just below the surface. But this was also a time of social and
  technological revolution bringing exciting new opportunities, especially for women.
  Using local newspapers and recently released records the author tells the story
  of the revolutionary years in Meath, keeping the people's experience always in focus.
