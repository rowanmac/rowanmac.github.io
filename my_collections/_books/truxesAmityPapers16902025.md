abstract: "The Amity Papers, 1690 reproduces 74 documents seized from the Irish vessel\
  \ Amity trading with France at the height of the Williamite War (1689-1691). Mostly\
  \ letters written by merchants (with a smaller number penned by Jacobite soldiers),\
  \ the ship's papers illustrate particularly the plight of civilians during the 1690\
  \ siege of Limerick, which ended just weeks before the Amity sailed. The writers\
  \ and their correspondents\u2013mostly living in France\u2013were part of two mercantile\
  \ networks, one Catholic and the other Quaker. The collaboration between the two\
  \ enabled Franco-Irish trade to continue despite wartime challenges. The letters\
  \ also illuminate the economic consequences of wartime conditions in Ireland: requisitioning,\
  \ the forced circulation of rapidly depreciating brass money, and the risks of buying\
  \ or selling goods in this context."
