abstract: "Peatlands \u2013 bogs, fens and heaths \u2013 are part of the Irish soul.\
  \ Neither water nor land and yet both, they were once considered gateways to the\
  \ otherworld. Bleak and beautiful, they are time capsules that hold a record of\
  \ history going back thousands of years. They supported Irish life for generations,\
  \ providing fuel and employment, and are home to flora and fauna found nowhere else.Carsten\
  \ Krieger, the author and photographer behind Wild Ireland, Ireland's Wild Atlantic\
  \ Way and many other titles, celebrates the magic and mystery of our peatlands.\
  \ He looks at the origin of these habitats, the often dark traditions associated\
  \ with the Irish peatlands, and how we can maintain the delicate balance between\
  \ man and nature into the future."
