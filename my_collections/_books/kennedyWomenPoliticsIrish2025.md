abstract: "The late-eighteenth-century 'age of revolutions' has long been identified\
  \ as a key moment in the gendering of modern democratic politics, one which opened\
  \ up new debates on the 'rights of women' while often re-affirming the masculinity\
  \ of the political citizen. In Ireland, the revolutionary era saw the rise of the\
  \ radical United Irish movement, mass popular mobilisation, and reached a violent\
  \ d\xE9nouement in the 1798 rebellion. But what did Ireland's age of revolution\
  \ mean for women? Was radical republicanism able to imagine women as political actors?\
  \ How did Irish women experience and navigate the intense ideological conflicts\
  \ of the 1790s? Addressing these and related questions, this is the first book-length\
  \ study of women and Irish politics in the late eighteenth century. Revising a stubborn\
  \ tendency to present women's political engagements in this period as largely mediated\
  \ through men, it stresses instead women's concerns, initiatives, and networks.\
  \ It reconstructs the distinctively gendered political cultures of Ireland's principal\
  \ communities\u2013the dynastic politics of the Protestant elite; the dynamic oppositional\
  \ culture of Belfast Presbyterianism; the urban and agrarian radicalism of unpropertied\
  \ Catholics\u2013and asks how these shaped the meanings of the 1790s for women.\
  \ In looking beyond the homosocial spaces of the club, pub, lodge, and corps, it\
  \ reveals a complexly gendered public sphere in which women were often active participants.\
  \ As the subjects of United Irish addresses, religious sermons, state surveillance,\
  \ and post-rebellion commemoration, women emerge as a clear, if overlooked, constituency\
  \ in Ireland's age of revolution. And it suggests how our understanding of revolution\
  \ might change when viewed from the perspective of women."
