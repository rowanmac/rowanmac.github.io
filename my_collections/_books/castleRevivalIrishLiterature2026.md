abstract: "The Revival in Irish Literature and Culture offers a wide variety of new\
  \ work on the Revival and the ideals, attitudes and perspectives that animate it,\
  \ from the late-nineteenth century to the present day. The contributors to the volume,\
  \ each in their own fashion, explore the social, political and cultural expressions\
  \ of revivalism in literature but also in film, music, dance, commemorations, museum\
  \ exhibits, social movements, and political activism. The volume offers new perspectives\
  \ on established figures and ideas as well as new research on forgotten or under-represented\
  \ revivalists, particularly women, whose cultural and political activities were\
  \ instrumental in forming the foundations of the Revival and whose ongoing involvement\
  \ shapes revivalism in new social and cultural contexts. One of the most important\
  \ thematic strands linking the chapters is the function of time-our understanding\
  \ of the historical \u201Csense of the past\u201D but also the efficacy of new temporal\
  \ frameworks."
