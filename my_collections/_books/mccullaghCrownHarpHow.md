abstract: "The crown was the symbol of British power in Ireland, and in December 1921\
  \ opponents of the Anglo-Irish Treaty claimed that its terms tied Ireland to the\
  \ Crown forever. The new Irish Free State would be within the British Commonwealth,\
  \ with limited sovereignty. And some believed it would stay that way if the Treaty\
  \ was accepted.\_And yet, within 16 years, Ireland had become a republic. A dozen\
  \ years after that, it acquired the name as well and removed any ambiguity about\
  \ its constitutional status by formally leaving the Commonwealth. And all without\
  \ the firing of a shot.\_This peaceful revolution had been achieved by a succession\
  \ of governments of different parties and a cast of characters that included a monarch\
  \ prepared to surrender his throne for love; a British prime minister who made Irish\
  \ neutrality possible and another who did his best to bully or bribe Ireland into\
  \ World War II. What had seemed impossible in 1921 had been achieved through relentless\
  \ pressure, considerable skill and no small amount of luck. This is the story of\
  \ how it happened."
