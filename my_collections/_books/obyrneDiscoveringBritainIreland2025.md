abstract: "Even as members of the social elite participated in the European Grand\
  \ Tour, travellers, writers, and readers increasingly recognized that Britain and\
  \ Ireland might offer sights and experiences to rival the continent. This collection\
  \ examines the practice and representation of tourism on 'home' ground during the\
  \ period when modern Britain was invented and became a powerful and prosperous imperial\
  \ nation. Interdisciplinary essays explore the diverse variety of tours and tourist\
  \ agendas \u2013 artistic, industrial, leisure, scientific \u2013 and they address\
  \ the ways in which travellers' 'discovery' of Britain and Ireland was an active\
  \ and often self-critical process that potentially encompassed encounters with the\
  \ alien and unfamiliar. Considering travellers from the wider world as well as from\
  \ within Britain and Ireland, contributors discuss the function of comparative reference\
  \ in contemporary travel-writing, as tourists often thought with and through others\
  \ as they reflected on the distinctiveness and significance of the sites that they\
  \ visited."
