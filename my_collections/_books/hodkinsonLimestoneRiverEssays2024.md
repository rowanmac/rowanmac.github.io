abstractNote: From Viking trading place to modern hi-tech city, Limerick's long history
  as Ireland's oldest Atlantic port has been played out against its natural backdrop
  of limestone and river. The stone circles of Lough Gur, the Norman strongholds of
  Askeaton and Adare as well as King John's Castle, the Treaty stone, the Georgian
  quarter of Newtown Pery, Cleeves Factory, and Thomond Park all stand proudly within
  this landscape today as monumental testimony to the region's character, a place
  where the peoples of Ireland and Britain have clashed, meshed, and evolved into
  a distinctive whole. With such a vibrant cultural inheritance, it is hardly surprising
  that Limerick is also the home of one of the oldest and biggest of Ireland's local
  history societies, first founded as the Limerick Naturalists Field Club in 1892
  and now the Thomond Archaeological and Historical Society (TAHS). This volume of
  essays on Limerick city and county has been put together in honour of Liam Irwin,
  retired Head of History in Mary Immaculate College and leading member of the society
  for forty years, by his many admirers and friends.
