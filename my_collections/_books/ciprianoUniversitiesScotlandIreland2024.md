abstractNote: Highlights the contested nature of higher education in the British Atlantic
  world between the Reformation and the EnlightenmentUniversities in the early modern
  period were powerful institutions in the formation of societies, utilised as both
  tools to legitimise and perpetuate the power of states and archetypes upon which
  to model an idealised society that might maintain social order. In an era of upheaval
  and civil war, rival authorities clashed in the universities, where the conflicts
  and complexities of early modern state formation were regularly laid bare.The encroachment
  of the Stuart monarchy beyond England into Scottish and Irish academe stimulated
  broader resistance from Scottish and Irish authorities, while prompting the founding
  of institutions of higher learning among expatriate communities beyond the British
  Isles, especially in New England. In these spaces, universities were viewed as institutional
  bulwarks against external intrusions that promoted localised, competing visions
  of the godly church and state amid the conflicts and complexities of early modern
  state formation.This book provides new insight into the contested nature of higher
  education in the British Atlantic world between the Reformation and the Enlightenment
  and corrects outmoded notions about the universities' purported insularity and intellectual
  poverty. Rather, the image that emerges of these universities is one of genuine
  academies of strategic importance, employed to serve the agendas of ruling powers
  in Scotland, Ireland, and New England. Trinity College, Dublin, Harvard College,
  and the Scottish universities existed on the frontiers of a deteriorating composite
  monarchy with a centralizing impulse, becoming battle grounds of the mid-seventeenth-century's
  intellectual, political, and religious conflicts.SALVATORE CIPRIANO is Associate
  Director of Career Coaching and Education, Stanford University. He holds a Ph.D.
  in Early Modern European History from Fordham University.
