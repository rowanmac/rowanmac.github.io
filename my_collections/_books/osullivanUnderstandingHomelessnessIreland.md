abstract: "A century after the state's foundation, Ireland faces an acute homelessness\
  \ crisis with families and children increasingly affected. This book uncovers how\
  \ decades of housing policy, financial decisions and social factors have shaped\
  \ today\u2019s housing insecurity. It is the first to take a historical approach,\
  \ tracing the roots of homelessness back to key policy decisions taken over the\
  \ past century.  By understanding how we got here, it offers crucial insights into\
  \ breaking the cycle. Essential reading for policy makers, scholars and anyone concerned\
  \ about Ireland\u2019s housing future, with lessons for other jurisdictions, this\
  \ book reveals why solving homelessness requires rethinking how we build and fund\
  \ housing."
