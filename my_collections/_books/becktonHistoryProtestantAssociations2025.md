abstract: "This book investigates the history of the Protestant voting blocs and associations\
  \ in the Irish border counties of Cavan, Donegal and Monaghan, from 1920 to 2016.\
  \ While there are many studies on the history of Irish Unionism and Protestantism,\
  \ there has been a lack of research concerning the political history of the Protestant\
  \ community in the border counties following partition. Many Protestant Unionists\
  \ in counties Cavan, Donegal, and Monaghan felt betrayed by their six county counterparts\
  \ breaking the Ulster Covenant in abandoning a nine-county Northern Ireland. However,\
  \ the Unionist Associations of these counties evolved after the implementation of\
  \ the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1922 and adapted to their new political environment\
  \ by becoming \u2018Protestant\u2019 Associations. The author seeks to explore how\
  \ these Associations were established, and how they reacted to political changes\
  \ during the twentieth century. Arguing that Protestant Associations arose as a\
  \ Unionist shock response to Ireland\u2019s partition in 1922, the author demonstrates\
  \ how they aimed to ensure their political representation and the maintaining of\
  \ Protestant interests. Support for these associations dwindled over time due to\
  \ demographic change, a decline in membership of the Orange Order, and the gradual\
  \ erosion of Southern Protestantism as a separate political identity over the course\
  \ of multiple generations. Shedding light on why these associations lasted until\
  \ the twenty-first century, and then disbanded, this book examines how former Southern\
  \ Unionists in the border counties evolved their political identity following partition."
