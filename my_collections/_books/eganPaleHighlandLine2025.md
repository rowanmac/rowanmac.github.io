abstract: This book offers important new insights into the history and culture of
  the Gaelic-speaking world from the mid-fifteenth century through to the reign of
  James VI and I. Throughout this period, the reach of the English and Scottish crowns
  within these western regions was limited. The initiative lay with local communities
  and royal power was contingent upon negotiating with well-established and largely
  autonomous aristocratic lineages. Moreover, events within this western world could
  exert a powerful, often unpredictable, influence upon the affairs of the wider archipelago.
  Using a series of case studies, this collection examines the evolving relationship
  between Ireland and Scotland in rich detail. It demonstrates how this world interacted
  with the encroaching English and Scottish states and underlines the importance of
  paying closer attention to this neglected area of Irish and British history.  --
