abstract: '''I found it fascinating - it''s an integral part of the history of Dublin
  that has been lost to time for too long'' - Rick O''SheaA feminist history of Europe''s
  largest red-light district and an examination of the lives of the women who worked
  there.Tucked away in Dublin''s north inner city, Monto - purported to be Europe''s
  biggest red-light district from 1860 to 1925 with up to 1600 sex workers at any
  one time - made headlines for wild tales of debauchery. However, what happened to
  the women and girls within its brothels in life and death is less clear.This account
  balances the historical origins of Monto''s rise and fall with an investigation
  into the inhumane and heartbreaking reality of the treatment of the women that worked
  there, while delving into the impact of class, sexual violence and British colonialism
  on the women''s survival. West explores the stigma and violence the women and girls
  of Monto endured, and investigates the shocking claims surrounding their treatment
  by medial professionals.Weaving together oral histories, historical records, fashion
  trends and family memories, this book brings the women of Monto to life within its
  pages as it explores how they lived, worked, loved, dressed, mourned and built a
  tight-knit community.'
