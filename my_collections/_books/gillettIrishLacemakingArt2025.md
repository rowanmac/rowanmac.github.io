abstract: "Following the career of the Irish lace designer and inspector Emily Anderson\
  \ (1856-1948), this book traces a network of designers, makers, organizations and\
  \ institutions involved in the late-19th and early-20th-century Irish lace industry\
  \ and explores their contemporary relevance. Molly-Claire Gillett maps the Irish\
  \ lace industry\u2019s connection to stakeholders such as the British Department\
  \ of Science and Art, the Cork School of Art, The Irish Agricultural Organisation\
  \ Society and the Irish Department of Agriculture and Technical Instruction, pairing\
  \ a close study of patterns and techniques with an investigation of broader issues\
  \ in design education, philanthropy and women\u2019s professionalization. Concluding\
  \ with a consideration of contemporary Irish lacemaking \u2013 now proudly claimed\
  \ as an element of Ireland\u2019s intangible cultural heritage \u2013 Gillett tells\
  \ the story of a 20th-century shift in the conception of lace design as \u2018art\
  \ for industry\u2019, and lacemaking as an economic necessity to both practices\
  \ as expressions of identity, creativity and community-building. Richly illustrated\
  \ and framed within the narrative of Anderson\u2019s life and career as a woman\
  \ designer and civil servant during a pivotal moment in Irish history, Irish Lacemaking\
  \ is an essential resource for students and researchers in craft, women\u2019s history\
  \ and Irish Studies."
