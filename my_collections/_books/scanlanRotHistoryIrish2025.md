abstract: In the 1800s, as Britain became the world's most powerful industrial empire,
  Ireland starved. The Great Famine fractured long-held assumptions about political
  economy and 'civilisation', threatening disorder in Britain. Ireland was a laboratory
  for empire, shaping British ideas about colonisation, population, ecology and work.In
  Rot, Padraic Scanlan reinterprets the history of this time and the result is a revelatory
  account of Ireland's Great Famine. In the first half of the nineteenth century,
  nowhere in Europe - or the world - did the working poor depend as completely on
  potatoes as in Ireland. To many British observers, potatoes were evidence of a lack
  of modernity among the Irish. However, Ireland before the famine more closely resembled
  capitalism's future than its past. While poverty before and during the Great Famine
  was often blamed on Irish backwardness, it did in fact stem from the British Empire's
  embrace of modern capitalism. Uncovering the disaster's roots in Britain's deep
  imperial faith in markets and capitalism, Rot reshapes our understanding of the
  Famine and its tragic legacy.'Richly underpinned by research in contemporary sources
  and firmly rooted in historical scholarship.' Fintan O'Toole'Rot is a moving modern
  history of the Great Potato Famine. With great insight and impeccable research,
  Padraic Scanlan vividly brings this terrible catastrophe and the stories of its
  heroes and villains back to life. Tyler Anbinder, author of City of Dreams'Rot brilliantly
  blends economic, social, and environmental history to deliver a stunning new account
  of one of nineteenth-century Europe's most shameful tragedies. Padraic Scanlan joins
  clear-eyed, comprehensive research and analysis to deliver a persuasive indictment
  of faith in free markets. As illuminating as it is harrowing, Rot is a must-read
  for anybody interested in the histories of capitalism and empire.' Maya Jasanoff,
  author of The Dawn Watch'Crisply written and based on an impressive range of contemporary
  sources, Padraic Scanlan's Rot is the best kind of historical writing.' Sean Connolly,
  author of On Every Tide'Rot is a book I have longed to read. Framing the Irish Famine
  within the context of the British empire is revelatory. An incredibly important
  work.' Sathnam Sanghera, author of Empireworld
