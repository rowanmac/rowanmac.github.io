abstract: '"Killester: from medieval manor to garden suburb" explores the development
  of Killester from its earliest days as Killester Demense, through its transformation
  in the early twentieth century as a garden suburb for ex-servicemen and onwards
  to the emergence of today''s suburb. Its history has given it a unique character
  and this is richly illustrated by maps and photographs. This is the first of a series
  of studies, entitled Dublin - Shaping the Suburbs, that explores the development
  of Dublin''s suburbs as many reach their centenary. This publication was commissioned
  by Dublin City Council as part of the Dublin City Strategic Heritage Plan 2023 to
  2028, and is part funded by the Heritage Council.'
