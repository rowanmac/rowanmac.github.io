abstract: "East Cork was a particularly violent area during the War of Independence\
  \ with many IRA ambushes and attacks on Crown Forces. The first major success nationally\
  \ for the IRA was the capture and destruction of Carrigtwohill RIC Barracks near\
  \ Midleton. The IRA\u2019s worst tragedy was at Clonmult, also near Midleton, when\
  \ the East Cork flying column was wiped out. During the war, twenty-two members\
  \ of the IRA, ten RIC and Black & Tans, thirteen British soldiers, and nine civilians\
  \ lost their lives violently in East Cork.This book presents a balanced history\
  \ of the war between the IRA and Crown Forces in East Cork, covering all areas of\
  \ the district. Featuring extensive lists of participants and a rich collection\
  \ of photographs and maps, this book uses original primary sources, contemporary\
  \ newspapers and documents to provide real, personal accounts of the action in East\
  \ Cork."
