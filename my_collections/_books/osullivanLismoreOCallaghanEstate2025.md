abstract: In this study, using the words of both the land agent, William Rochfort
  (1847- 1940), and the tenants on the Lismore (O' Callaghan) estate in Counties Cork,
  Limerick and Tipperary, the land agent- tenant relationship between 1891 and 1902
  is explored. The techniques employed by Rochfort to investigate the personal circumstances
  of his tenants, his treatment of them and his ability to occasionally provide discreet
  assistance to those in need are all examined. Issues of most concern to the tenants,
  as told in their own words, are considered.
