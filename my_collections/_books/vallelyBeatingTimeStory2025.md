abstract: "The Irish frame drum that we know as 'bodhr\xE1n' first entered modern-day\
  \ Irish consciousness in 1959 with John B. Keane's use of a tambourine in his play\
  \ Sive at the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. From 1960 onwards, it gained tremendous visibility\
  \ in the traditional music revival through Se\xE1n \xD3 Riada's Radio \xC9ireann\
  \ ensemble Ceolt\xF3ir\xED Chualann, then by the Chieftains, and, later, by the\
  \ Bothy Band, Planxty, Christy Moore and De Dannan. By the end of the century, tens\
  \ of thousands of bodhr\xE1ns had been made and dispersed worldwide, and the instrument\
  \ was a staple in traditional music promoted by Comhaltas Ceolt\xF3ir\xED \xC9ireann.\
  \ Today the drum holds a remarkable symbolic presence not only in Irish music, but\
  \ also in tourism and in sport, to the extent that it rivals the harp as a national\
  \ emblem. To date there has been no coherent picture of how the bodhr\xE1n could\
  \ appear so suddenly in the twentieth century. Its name is certainly old - a word\
  \ once used for a device which was created millennia ago as an agricultural tool,\
  \ a container and tray. But as a percussion form with the sophistication that we\
  \ know it today its traceable history is short, beginning sporadically only in the\
  \ earlier 1800s, and mostly happening since c.1960, shaped by ingenious stylists,\
  \ most of whom are indeed still performing among us. Beating Time explores this\
  \ history for the first time. It radically acknowledges not only the influence of\
  \ the music trade and British military bands, but that of the touring ensembles\
  \ that were the roots of today's popular music - the American 'blackface' minstrels.\
  \ The study also examines the use of tambourines on the 'Wren', and the morphing\
  \ of this into accompaniment and solo playing in today's 'listening' traditional\
  \ music. Perhaps most remarkable is the unspoken re-branding of the tambourine as\
  \ 'bodhr\xE1n', and its kindling, liberation and validation of the percussion impulse\
  \ in traditional music. Rather than mythicising the bodhr\xE1n as the oldest Irish\
  \ music instrument, this book points to the idea that it should perhaps be celebrated\
  \ for being the newest. Its rapid emergence and transformation is as remarkable\
  \ and astonishing an ascent in universal popularity and international acceptance\
  \ as has been the worldwide rise of the guitar in all music."
