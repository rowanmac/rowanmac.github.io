abstract: "Italian and Irish immigrant experiencesWhen people migrate, they often\
  \ perform social and cultural rituals along the way. The idea of rites of passage\u2014\
  with its elements of preparation, departure, transit, admission, exclusion, expulsion,\
  \ and return\u2014help us understand these moments in the process of migration in\
  \ new and meaningful ways.Rituals of Migration offers snapshots of Italian and Irish\
  \ migrants on the move from the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The essays\
  \ in this volume examine the particular moments, actions, sentiments, and material\
  \ objects in the process of migration\u2014at the point of departure, in transit,\
  \ and in the process of return. Because rites and rituals feature both nonverbal\
  \ and verbal expression, migration history can be understood by studying physical\
  \ objects as well as written sources. The authors focus on rituals created by migrants\
  \ and their descendants, but they also consider the actions of officials who regulated\
  \ migrants\u2019 departure, travel, admission, exclusion, and removal. By examining\
  \ what people did, thought, felt, and packed on the eve of their departures, during\
  \ their journeys, and when returning to their homelands, Rituals of Migration reveals\
  \ how everyone involved in the immigration process, including the migrants themselves,\
  \ the families they left behind, and those in charge of regulating their mobility,\
  \ have tried to make sense of a process filled with peril, uncertainty, excitement,\
  \ and opportunity."
