abstract: "Maps allow us to see how the world is organised spatially and show us relationships\
  \ which cannot be understood from simply reading a text. This magnificent book highlights\
  \ a vast selection of maps that range across the centuries and cover every part\
  \ of the island, shedding light on the history and development of Ireland.The themes\
  \ are many and varied, from conquest and colonisation, the management of the landscape,\
  \ natural resources, meeting the needs of tourists, transport, the growth of urban\
  \ centres as well as exploring how others saw Ireland, and much more besides.\_\
  \ Carefully selected by two noted map experts, this highly visual book tells the\
  \ story of Ireland in a unique and stimulating way."
