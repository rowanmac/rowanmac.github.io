abstractNote: "Robert Childers Barton was one of the most enigmatic figures to emerge\
  \ from the Irish Revolution, and his place in history was assured when he signed\
  \ the Anglo-Irish treaty. Although he was a confidante of de Valera, Barton accepted\
  \ the terms on offer in 1921. He voted for the document in both the Cabinet and\
  \ the D\xE1il, recommending the treaty to the House in his Treaty Debate speech.\
  \ Subsequently, however, he took the anti-treaty side in the Civil War.Although\
  \ he was central to the birth of the nation, Barton has remained understudied and\
  \ neglected. This first study of his life focuses on his role during the Irish Revolution,\
  \ charting his political journey from a Unionist background, through Home Rule and\
  \ Dual Monarchism, to Republicanism and his later anti-treaty stance. Using multiple\
  \ sources, including extensive archival material, this book traces the life, times\
  \ and legacy of a remarkable revolutionary."
