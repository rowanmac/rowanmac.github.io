abstract: "Putting Joyce back into dialogue with other Irish writers of his generation,\
  \ this book shows that his experiments with narrative styles and structures were\
  \ a renegotiation rather than a rejection of earlier Irish conventions. While Joyce\
  \ is undoubtedly the best known, other Irish writers were also influenced by European\
  \ movements in naturalism and decadence that were shaping European Modernism as\
  \ it emerged in the 1890s. Reading Joyce's works in the context of often forgotten\
  \ contemporaries such as George Moore, George Egerton, Hannah Lynch, Shan Bullock,\
  \ Forrest Reid and Charlotte O\u2019Conor Eccles enhances our understanding of their\
  \ works as well as Joyce\u2019s, both thematically and stylistically, and shines\
  \ a much-needed light on previously critically underexamined writers. By focusing\
  \ on the transformation of Joyce from Irish writer to Modernist artist we gain crucial\
  \ insights into why many of Joyce\u2019s contemporaries are not read today despite\
  \ their initial popularity. This book utilises Joyce\u2019s troubled publication\
  \ and reception history to identify the wider trends of the Irish short story cycle\
  \ and Bildungsroman, thereby enhancing readers\u2019 understanding of the literary\
  \ marketplace for Irish books in this period.\u201D"
