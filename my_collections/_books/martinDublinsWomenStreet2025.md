abstract: "A ballad about a woman street trader is widely regarded as Dublin's anthem,\
  \ yet the city's relationship with those who traded on its streets was often acrimonious.\
  \ From 1882 onwards efforts commenced to have street traders banned alongside gentrification\
  \ projects. A watershed came with the passage of the Street Trading Act of 1926.\
  \ This book examines the resistance of the traders when those with power refused\
  \ to recognize them as stakeholders. What the establishment learned was that the\
  \ women were prepared to engage in civil disobedience, endure violence from Garda\xED\
  \ and serve time in jail to both protect their livelihoods and protest what they\
  \ characterized as ' banishment to the slums' ."
