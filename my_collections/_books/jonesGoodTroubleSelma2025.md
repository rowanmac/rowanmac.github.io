abstract: Good Trouble will show the strong connection between the Black Civil Rights
  Movement in the United States and the Catholic Civil Rights Movement in Northern
  Ireland - specifically the influence of the Montgomery to Selma march on the 1969
  Belfast to Derry march through oral history, based on numerous interviews of events
  leading up to both marches and afterwards. This is close to the author's heart as
  both of his parents marched to integrate lunch counters and movie theatres in Salisbury,
  North Carolina, in 1963 as college students. His mother was at the 1963 March to
  Washington where Martin Luther King gave his 'I Have a Dream' speech. Award winning
  author Julieann Campbell (On Bloody Sunday) wrote the introduction for Good Trouble,
  looking back at her times growing up in Derry, in the heart of the Catholic Civil
  Rights Movement. Jones travelled to Dublin, Belfast and Derry to conduct interviews
  for the book. In all, he did fifteen interviews with people who were involved in
  the movement in Northern Ireland (including Billy McVeigh - featured in the BAFTA
  winning documentary, Once Upon A Time In Northern Ireland) and in the United States
  (including Richard Smiley and Dr. Sheyann Webb-Christburg - both were at Bloody
  Sunday in Alabama and on the Selma to Montgomery march among others). Jones was
  also able to talk with Eamonn McCann (he took part in the Belfast to Derry march
  in 1969; he was the John Lewis of Northern Ireland). Unlike most books on Northern
  Ireland, this goes into detail about the connection and the influence between the
  two movements. Also, most focus on Bloody Sunday and not the pivotal incidents at
  Burntollet Bridge and the Battle of the Bogside. Building off of unprecedented access
  and interviews with participants in both movements, Jones crafts a gripping and
  moving account of these pivotal years for both countries.
