abstract: "On a balmy July evening in 1972, soundtracked by The Dubliners, Muhammad\
  \ Ali climbed through the ropes to fight Al \u2018Blue\u2019 Lewis at Croke Park.\
  \ The most famous athlete in the world had somehow been inveigled to Ireland by\
  \ Butty Sugrue, a former circus strongman turned charismatic entrepreneur. He was\
  \ ridiculed for trying to do the impossible right up to the moment Ali and his entourage\
  \ touched down at Dublin Airport. So began a magical week of the most glorious mayhem,\
  \ as \u2018the Champ\u2019 charmed the Irish people.Ali could be found jogging along\
  \ Wicklow lanes, strolling into The Old Stand pub, chatting with street cleaners,\
  \ and paying an early morning visit to the GPO to receive a history lesson about\
  \ the Easter Rising. No matter where he fetched up, wonderful chaos ensued. Traffic\
  \ stopped. Crowds gathered. The greatest show on earth had come to town.Through\
  \ interviews with dozens of those Ali met and worked with over the course of those\
  \ unforgettable days, Dave Hannigan has pieced together an enthralling narrative\
  \ of one of the most unique events in Irish sporting history."
