abstract: "Long recognized as Ireland's greatest demographic disaster in recent history,\
  \ the Great Famine of 1845\u20131851 has shaped Irish identities around the world.\
  \ From the monuments erected to commemorate its victims to the political rhetoric\
  \ involving it to the novels, poems, songs, and films that it continues to inspire,\
  \ the Famine remains a crucial part of Irish memory. Famine memories have also reached\
  \ across history and national borders to establish links with cultural groups who\
  \ were not directly connected to the Irish diaspora.Periodical Famines reveals how,\
  \ within the transatlantic Irish periodical market between 1845 and 1910, Irish,\
  \ Irish American, and Irish Canadian newspapers and magazines acted as carriers\
  \ and shapers of cultural identities. Lindsay Janssen argues that famine memory\
  \ was deployed transhistorically to help represent other crucial events in the Irish\
  \ past, and periodicals used Famine recollections transnationally to give new meaning\
  \ to events outside of Ireland, such as labor issues in the United States and the\
  \ Second Boer War. Moving beyond individual writings to interrogate how different\
  \ texts printed within a periodical issue influenced each other and affected audiences'\
  \ attitudes to Irish hunger and distress, Janssen's cotextual approach reveals the\
  \ intricate and sometimes divergent paths that Famine memory traveled through in\
  \ the decades during and after its onset.Drawing upon a substantial corpus of creative\
  \ and nonfiction periodical publications (including nearly 600 works of poetry and\
  \ prose fiction), Periodical Famines is a thorough analysis of transatlantic Irish\
  \ periodical culture during and after the Great Famine, demonstrating how periodicals'\
  \ transmission of famine memories shaped global cultures."
