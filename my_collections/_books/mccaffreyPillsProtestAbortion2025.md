abstract: "The Republic of Ireland lived under one of the strictest abortion bans\
  \ in Europe for decades, then in 2018, their voters passed one of the most liberal\
  \ abortion provision schemes in the world.Pills & Protest: Abortion Access in Ireland\
  \ tells the story of how feminist activists strategically used abortion pills to\
  \ help people while abortion was illegal and to influence the legal and medical\
  \ changes to come. Drawing on three years of interviews with activists, doctors,\
  \ and politicians in Ireland, Brenna McCaffrey illuminates the story of how the\
  \ abortion pill transitioned from a controversial object to a legally recognized\
  \ medical solution. The result is an energizing story \u2013 one of creative protest,\
  \ passion, and activism in pursuit of reproductive freedom. Pills and Protest demonstrates\
  \ how understanding medication abortion is essential to understanding reproductive\
  \ healthcare in Ireland \u2013 and globally \u2013 today."
