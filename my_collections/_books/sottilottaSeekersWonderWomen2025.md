abstract: "Women\u2019s cultural and political engagement with oral tales and traditions\
  \ in European peripheries With Seekers of Wonder, Elena Sottilotta offers the first\
  \ comparative study of women\u2019s manifold roles in the collection of Italian\
  \ and Irish folklore and fairy tales between 1870 and 1920. Sottilotta views the\
  \ often-overlooked work of these women from an interdisciplinary perspective, considering\
  \ both the politics and poetics of seeking wonder. In so doing, she centers women\u2019\
  s influence on the preservation and dissemination of oral traditions, bringing work\
  \ that was once relegated to the margins into dialogue with work long regarded as\
  \ canonical.After mapping sidelined, marginalized, and forgotten women folklorists,\
  \ Sottilotta narrows the focus onto four writers and collectors who were inspired\
  \ by Italian and Irish insular contexts: Laura Gonzenbach, who collected Sicilian\
  \ wonder tales; Grazia Deledda, who wrote Sardinian ethnographic sketches, legends,\
  \ and fairy tales; Jane Wilde, who published anthologies of Irish folklore; and\
  \ Augusta Gregory, who collected traditional narratives in the west of Ireland.\
  \ Situated within an ongoing process of rediscovery of lesser-known collectors,\
  \ tellers, and tales in the European tradition, Sottilotta relocates these figures\
  \ within a broader transcultural framework.Throughout, Sottilotta emphasizes the\
  \ role of women as crucial intermediaries between different cultural groups\u2015\
  in particular, between the world of the \u201Cfolk\u201D and the world of scholarly\
  \ folklore studies. Unearthing rare archival material and reading these writings\
  \ from the perspective of gender, Sottilotta sheds light on the identity dynamics\
  \ that animated the cultural phenomenon of collecting folk and fairy tales in this\
  \ era."
