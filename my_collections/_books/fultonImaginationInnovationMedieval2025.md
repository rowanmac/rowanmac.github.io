abstract: "The literatures of medieval Wales and Ireland are among the richest vernacular\
  \ traditions of medieval Europe. From a large corpus of poetry and prose, key texts\
  \ such as the Welsh Mabinogion, the Irish sagas, Celtic Latin literature, chronicles,\
  \ saints\u2019 lives and court poetry have established their place within the written\
  \ legacy of medieval Europe. This collection of original essays by leading Celtic\
  \ scholars, writing in honour of Catherine McKenna, Professor of Celtic at Harvard\
  \ University, goes beyond the familiar canon of medieval Celtic literatures to showcase\
  \ a wide range of Welsh and Irish texts that are compelling in their literary imagination\
  \ and technical innovation."
