abstract: "Ireland has long been the focus of research into its geological foundations\
  \ and history. This book provides insights into the evolution of geological ideas\
  \ in Ireland, gives assessments of underrepresented scientists, and offers an appreciation\
  \ of the value of geological collections for historical research.\nThrough a series\
  \ of twenty-two papers, this volume provides syntheses and analyses of aspects of\
  \ this geological research and places the role of a number of individuals firmly\
  \ within context. The topics discussed include the considerations of the nature\
  \ of igneous rocks, aspects of geological mapping of the country, the role played\
  \ by Irish scientists in determining the age of the Earth, and the importance of\
  \ early mineralogical and geological collectors and the role their collections made\
  \ to advancing geological knowledge both in Ireland and Europe.\nThe Making of Irish\
  \ Geology 1740\u20131940 will appeal to both the general and academic reader interested\
  \ in the development of the geological sciences, with a particular focus on Ireland."
