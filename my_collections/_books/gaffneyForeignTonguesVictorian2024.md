abstract: "The first historical overview of the study of languages in Ireland from\
  \ an expert in the area. How history shifts languages and languages in turn shape\
  \ history is a deep-rooted, dynamic process manifest in Victorian Ireland. In Foreign\
  \ Tongues, Phyllis Gaffney sheds new light on this period of Irish history, exploring\
  \ how continental influences that predated the Penal Laws were reinvigorated in\
  \ the wake of the French Revolution. An influx of foreign teachers and religious\
  \ orders created institutions for an emerging \xE9lite, and University education\
  \ expanded. At the same time, civil service reforms opened careers across the British\
  \ Empire to graduates from all religions. The result is that Ireland\u2019s Victorian\
  \ colleges embraced language study\u2014ancient and modern, Irish and European\u2014\
  more eagerly than their British counterparts. An adaptive, fast-changing academic\
  \ landscape laid the groundwork for today\u2019s Ireland\u2014culturally confident,\
  \ open to Europe and the world\u2014while the dramatic rise of the Gaelic League\
  \ forged a bond between language, education, and politics with pervasive effects\
  \ on Irish identities in the twentieth century. None of that was plain sailing.\
  \ Gaffney\u2019s profiles of individual professors reveal pioneering scholarship,\
  \ precarious careers, sudden scandals, and denunciations and dismissals linked to\
  \ local conflicts and foreign wars. On the positive side, the advance of women\u2019\
  s education cleared the path for a cohort of notable female professors across modern\
  \ languages. This wide-ranging, detailed study draws on multiple sources to cast\
  \ a fresh light on aspects of Irish history, viewed through the complex lens of\
  \ language education."
