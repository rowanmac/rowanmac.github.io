abstract: "This companion contains new and innovative writing on Irish art and its\
  \ history, from c. 1800 to the present day.\nThis book critically engages with Irish\
  \ art in a period linked to key events in Irish history, beginning with the Acts\
  \ of Union between Britain and Ireland (1800\u201301)) and the significant social\
  \ and cultural changes that resulted. The book also provides a precedent for a focus\
  \ on the significance of art in relation to other subsequent key historical events\
  \ such as the early twentieth\u2011century struggles for independence or the role\
  \ of political conflict in Northern Ireland from the late 1960s onwards and its\
  \ aftermath. Key themes covered include tradition and innovation; upheavals of history;\
  \ place, location, and artistic formations; Irish art and the wider world; and embodiment\
  \ and identity. The book expands the critical discourse around Irish art over this\
  \ period, both within Ireland and beyond, and encourages the potential for future\
  \ scholarship in fields and periods not covered.\nThis book will be of interest\
  \ to scholars and students working in art history, Irish studies, and colonial studies."
