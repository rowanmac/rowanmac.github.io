abstract: "The Stained and Bloodied Cloths of Ireland presents a textiles and material\
  \ culture view of Irish shame, oppression, morality and repression. Ireland \u2013\
  \ North and South \u2013 has sustained significant change in the last 100 years,\
  \ accelerating at the end of the 20th century with the legalization of contraception,\
  \ divorce, gay marriage, the end of the \u2018Troubles\u2019, and freedom to choose\
  \ abortion and reproductive autonomy. In parallel to this, troubling instances of\
  \ abuse, repression and cruelty have come to light through a series of scandals.\
  \ These included the exploitation of unmarried mothers as unpaid labour in laundries,\
  \ the deaths of women and babies in mishandled miscarriages, the unhealthy entanglement\
  \ of Church and State, and the intolerance shown to 'visible Irish and immigrant\
  \ minorities' in the so-called \u2018land of a thousand welcomes\u2019. This collection\
  \ of specially commissioned essays tells the stories of cloth, clothing, textiles\
  \ and materials that have been actually or symbolically stained by blood or other\
  \ bodily fluids in Ireland\u2019s last 100 years. By focusing on the role of these\
  \ materials in the events and experiences of shame, oppression, morality and repression,\
  \ the book \u2018lances the boil\u2019 of Irish social history, celebrating the\
  \ movement of the island of Ireland into post-Church, post-conflict, post-nostalgia\
  \ modernity that, while a painful transition, is a vital part of coming to terms\
  \ with its past and looking to its future."
