abstract: "\u2018I was in the Army over thirty years and Derry was the most resentful\
  \ place I ever served, even the dogs hated us.\u2019 When civil rights protests\
  \ in the 1960s gave way to armed struggle, the Provisional IRA in Derry \u2013 both\
  \ city and county \u2013 led the fight against the British security forces. In the\
  \ city Martin McGuinness \u2013 a young butcher\u2019s assistant from the Bogside\
  \ \u2013 quickly rose through the ranks, launching a bombing campaign that reduced\
  \ the city centre to rubble. In tandem, the IRA\u2019s active service units fought\
  \ the British Army in the streets and alleys of the Bogside, Creggan, Shantallow\
  \ and the Waterside. Out in the townlands, a new generation from the county\u2019\
  s traditional republican families waged an equally ruthless war against their neighbours\
  \ in the RUC and UDR. The Derry Brigade\u2019s success would help propel McGuinness\
  \ to the very top of the IRA\u2019s Army Council. By the early 1980s the Derry Brigade\
  \ appeared untouchable. However, in reality, Special Branch and British Intelligence\
  \ had infiltrated it from top to bottom and almost destroyed the brigade. By the\
  \ mid-1990s its war was all but over, its ranks decimated by death and incarceration.\
  \ This is the story of that war told by those from all sides who survived it."
