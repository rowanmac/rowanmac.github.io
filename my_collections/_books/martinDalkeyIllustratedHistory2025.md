abstract: Dalkey, lying on the coast of South Dublin, is one of the most picturesque
  and affluent areas of all of Ireland. It has been home to some of Ireland's most
  well-known writers, authors and musicians, from George Bernard Shaw and Robert Fisk
  to Bono and Enya.This book is aimed at both the general reader and those with a
  particular interest in local history of the area. The time period extends from the
  earliest settlement about 5,000 BC to the present day, covering Dalkey, Bullock
  and Dalkey Island. The second part deals with the urban development of Dalkey in
  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, in relation to topics such as housing, transport,
  and services. The final two chapters provide brief pen-pictures of people who either
  helped shape its development or who made a mark in their chosen careers. Each chapter
  is illustrated with historic maps, engravings, paintings and photos.
