abstract: "'The best book about Irish politics you can read ... O'Malley has produced\
  \ one of the finest books ever written about modern Irish politics' - William Stephens,\
  \ Gript'A rattling good read' - David McCullagh, RT\xC9'A fantastic read' - Hugh\
  \ Linehan, Irish TimesThe two opposing political figures that shaped Irish life\
  \ in the 1980s and beyond.In the 1980s, Irish politics was dominated by a fierce\
  \ rivalry between Charles J. Haughey and Dr Garret FitzGerald, both leaders of their\
  \ respective parties, Fianna F\xE1il and Fine Gael. Between them they each led all\
  \ Irish governments in that decade; to say their two opposing personalities shaped\
  \ Irish life during this era is an understatement.Eoin O'Malley has amassed an extraordinary\
  \ body of research, including in-depth interviews with dozens of the most consequential\
  \ public figures of the time, every Taoiseach, cabinet ministers, TDs, civil servants,\
  \ and advisers.As political rivals with different approaches to public life and\
  \ contrasting visions for Ireland, each enshrined in quite different personalities,\
  \ the choice between Haughey and FitzGerald came to signify a great deal more than\
  \ party loyalty or policy preference: it felt like a choice between opposing worldviews.\
  \ And, as O'Malley's work finally makes clear through an accumulation of extraordinary\
  \ insights, including interviews with Haughey and FitzGerald themselves, it was\
  \ fed by a deep reservoir of personal insecurity and paranoia. Each was deeply preoccupied\
  \ - obsessed even - with the strengths, appeal and threats of the other, to the\
  \ extent that this rivalry itself became one of the decisive factors in Irish life\
  \ that shaped Ireland well after they had left power."
