abstract: "Cen\xE9 l nE\xF3 gain, a royal dynasty from Inishowen in Donegal, defeated\
  \ its previously more successful opponent, Cen\xE9 l Conaill - also from Donegal\
  \ - at the battle of Cl\xF3 itech in AD 789. All changed following that battle.\
  \ From then on, the Cen\xE9 l nE\xF3 gain kingdom, known as ' Ailech', spread across\
  \ Counties Derry, Tyrone (giving that territory its name), into Armagh, and dominated\
  \ the whole territory of Ulster. It also attained, alternately, the higher kingship\
  \ of Tara. After surnames appeared c.1000, the Mac Lochlainns and O' Neills became\
  \ Cen\xE9 l nE\xF3 gain's leading families. Meanwhile, the defeated Cen\xE9 l Conaill\
  \ struggled to maintain some degree of prestige following the emergence of a previously\
  \ minor, upstart kingdom, originally from west Donegal, the S\xED l Lugdach. By\
  \ c.1200 the O' Neills and the leading S\xED l Lugdach family, the O' Donnells,\
  \ were in position to rule the whole of Ulster until the English conquest c.1600.\
  \ This book outlines in detail how that situation came about."
