abstract: "\"In the summer of 1847, over four hundred ships arrived in the Gulf of\
  \ St Lawrence, carrying Irish men, women, and children who were fleeing the starvation\
  \ and misery of the Great Potato Famine. Tens of thousands of famine refugees rebuilt\
  \ their lives in different parts of Canada, in places urban and rural, Anglophone\
  \ and Francophone. Though still a young province within the British Empire, Canada\
  \ would be marked permanently and in significant ways by this mass migration. Canada\
  \ and the Great Irish Famine examines how people confronted, experienced, and remembered\
  \ the famine migration. Essays consider the transatlantic voyage; the collection\
  \ of donations and organization of aid; the challenges encountered by the cities\
  \ of Quebec, Saint John, Montreal, Toronto, Kingston, and Hamilton and their public\
  \ debates over the impact of so many new arrivals; the accompanying problems of\
  \ disease, destitution, mental illness, death and burial; the stories of orphaned\
  \ children; and expressions of famine memory. The worst demographic catastrophe\
  \ in nineteenth-century Europe inspired generations of political writings, artistic\
  \ and literary endeavours, and commemorative practices, and it was woven into narratives\
  \ of Irish nationalism and the founding of Canada. Canada and the Great Irish Famine\
  \ provides a new perspective on the social outcomes of Ireland\u2019s famine migration\
  \ as well as on the resilience and adaptability of the receiving communities and\
  \ the migrants themselves. William Jenkins is associate professor of history at\
  \ York University and the current president of the Canadian Association for Irish\
  \ Studies. He is the author of Between Raid and Rebellion: The Irish in Buffalo\
  \ and Toronto, 1867\u20131916.\"-- Provided by publisher"
