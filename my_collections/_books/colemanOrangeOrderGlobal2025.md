abstract: "On a sunny day, men and women march through the streets wearing orange\
  \ collarettes and carrying colourful banners. However, this is not the Orange Order\
  \ in Northern Ireland but the same organisation in Africa. This book moves beyond\
  \ the clich\xE9 to delve deeply into the inner structure and rituals of the Orange\
  \ Order and its global reach. The Orange Order, while Irish Protestant-founded,\
  \ managed in a short period to spread to not only other parts of the UK, but also\
  \ to Australia, New Zealand and even Africa. Previous research has tended to focus\
  \ on just one to two countries within a narrow timeframe. This book, by contrast,\
  \ covers almost 230 years of the Orange Order across multiple countries. Unlike\
  \ other studies, it integrates the activities of men, women and children."
