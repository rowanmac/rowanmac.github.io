abstract: The early 17th Century was a time of great turbulence in our society, but
  also of continuity. Most importantly to us, it was a time of diligent record keeping
  which we can access today to understand better where we have come from. From the
  licence to distil whiskey in 1608 to the statistics which even then oiled the wheels
  of government, we can recognise our modern world in the records of 400 years ago.Fundamental
  to 'place' is (or was) the townland - confusing to outsiders (and now many of us
  locals) this unit of land has been in use for centuries, from the 12th-century land
  grants of mediaeval monasteries to the line on your domestic rates bill today. Until
  the mid-20th century (and much later in some localities), rural addresses were given
  exclusively by townland and the road names and numbers we use today were meaningless
  to country dwellers. Small enough to be personal in scale but significant enough
  for government use, townlands stood the test of time until the processing power
  of computers and our increasingly mobile and urbanised society brought in postcodes
  and an increasing number of administrative divisions adrift from our history.This
  publication maps all 16,000 townlands in the 9 counties of Ulster and the administrative
  units of church and state into which they have been organised. In an attractive
  and easily understood layout, these units are shown in the context of land ownership
  in the 17th century, a pattern clearly recognisable until a century ago when the
  Land Purchase Acts broke up the estates and facilitated tenant farmers buying their
  own land. By using the maps and index, family and local historians can easily grasp
  the essentials of our ancestors' lives - where they worked, paid their rent, went
  to church and market, etc.This is an essential reference guide for both newcomer
  and serious researcher, showing exact locations and where to look for related records.
  This material has never been collated for the entire province before.
