abstractNote: How did the Irish stay Irish? Why are Irish and Catholic still so often
  synonymous in the English-speaking world? Ireland's Empire is the first book to
  examine the complex relationship between Irish migrants and Roman Catholicism in
  the nineteenth century on a truly global basis. Drawing on more than 100 archives
  on five continents, Colin Barr traces the spread of Irish Roman Catholicism across
  the English-speaking world and explains how the Catholic Church became the vehicle
  for Irish diasporic identity in the United States, Australia, Canada, South Africa,
  New Zealand, Newfoundland, and India between 1829 and 1914. The world these Irish
  Catholic bishops, priests, nuns, and laity created endured long into the twentieth
  century, and its legacy is still present today.
