abstractNote: "This book offers a novel approach to studying war and peace by foregrounding\
  \ motherhood in times of conflict and peace processes from a sociological perspective.\
  \ Through qualitative research resting on individual and focus group interviews\
  \ with 55 mothers who had lived through the Northern Ireland conflict, this book\
  \ examines the gendered nature of coping with conflict and its aftermath in peace\
  \ processes. Drawing on the idea of everyday life peacebuilding, it discusses how\
  \ the family is located in the processes of social transformation in conflict-affected\
  \ societies, and illuminates that mothers play central yet largely unnoticed roles\
  \ in maintaining and restoring sociability in a conflict-affected society. The book\
  \ illustrates that mothers have been hidden and underappreciated \u2018everyday\
  \ peacebuilders\u2019, as well as hidden and trivialised victims of the conflict."
