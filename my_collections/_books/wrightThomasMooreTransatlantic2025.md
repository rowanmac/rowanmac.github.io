abstract: 'Thomas Moore has long been considered Ireland''s national bard and the
  face of colonial grievance in Ireland. But he also grew up in a port city and then
  travelled with and worked for the British Navy. Dubbing himself ''transatlantic
  Tom'', Moore rode and wrote about the currents of the north Atlantic and coastal
  locations key to naval operations and trade routes. Following Moore on these lines
  of motion allows us to trace local and global circuits, including literary networks,
  agricultural trade, interests in the Atlantic fishery, migration, military activity
  and the coercions of the slave trade. Powered by water, such motion pulls against
  the fictions of stable, bounded property necessary to the British Empire and influential
  in British Romanticism. Moore not only transits Irish Romanticism and British Romanticism:
  he is also a window onto a sea-level view of the Romantic era.'
