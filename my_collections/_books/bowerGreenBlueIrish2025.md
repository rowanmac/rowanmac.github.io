abstract: Damian Shiels's Green and Blue explores Irish American service in the United
  States military by analyzing the written correspondence of ordinary rank-and-file
  soldiers drawn from across the Union's armed forces. Using a vast and largely untapped
  collection of letters penned by Irish American combatants to their families during
  the war, Shiels explains how these enlisted men navigated their duties from multiple
  perspectives, including how they adapted to and experienced military life, how they
  engaged with their faith, and how they interacted with the home front. Green and
  Blue offers the most detailed and intimate picture yet of Irish Americans' service
  in the United States military during the Civil War.
