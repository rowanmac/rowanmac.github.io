abstract: "This book is a study of the print cultures of the four principal Celtic\
  \ languages \u2015 Irish, Welsh, Gaelic and Breton \u2015 in the crucial period\
  \ between 1700 and 1900.Over the past four centuries, the Celtic languages of northwest\
  \ Europe have followed contrasting paths of maintenance and decline. This was despite\
  \ their common lack of official recognition and use, and their common distance from\
  \ the centres of political power. This volume analyses publishing, circulation and\
  \ reading in the four languages, particularly at a popular level, showing the different\
  \ levels of overall activity as well as the distinctions in the types of printed\
  \ texts between regions. The approach is a broad one, considering all printed books\
  \ down to very small cheap formats. It explores the interactions between the different\
  \ regions and the continuation of print culture within diasporic communities.This\
  \ volume will appeal to book historians, to scholars of the four languages and their\
  \ literature, and to students of Celtic studies."
