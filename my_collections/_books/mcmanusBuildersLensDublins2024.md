abstractNote: Many people have helped create Dublin's unique streetscapes. This book
  looks at the builders and their projects and draws on the extraordinarily rich photographic
  archive of one of Dublin's foremost construction companies, G. & T. Crampton, as
  it explores the evolution of the capital from the Edwardian period to the late 1980s.
  These images show the changing approaches and fashions as the projects reflected
  a growing capital city during the twentieth century. The transformation of the city
  is considered, not just in terms of fine public buildings and impressive commercial
  premises, but also through many everyday structures providing for the housing, employment,
  education, entertainment and shopping needs of its citizens. Dublin changed greatly
  during the twentieth century. The city spread far beyond its old boundaries as suburban
  housing for all income groups was built, and the locations of industry and commerce
  also shifted in response. Naturally, the building industry responded to these changing
  circumstances, as revealed by these images, from the emphasis on quality housing
  for workers in the 1920s at Marino and Drumcondra, to the hospitals built using
  money from the Sweepstakes, or the modern office buildings of the 1960s. In photos
  taken during construction or shortly after its completion, we see the pristine buildings
  as they were imagined by their architects. Each chapter includes an overview of
  key trends and issues, as well as maps, photographs and explanations of individual
  building projects which serve to illustrate the discussion and demonstrate how the
  streetscape evolved through time.
