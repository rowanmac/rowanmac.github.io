abstract: In 1014, at the famous Battle of Clontarf, the High King of Ireland, Brian
  Boru, in conjunction with the provincial chiefs, defeated the colonizing Norsemen
  in a decisive battle which ended their efforts to conquer Ireland. At this time
  Clontarf was open countryside bordered by the Irish Sea. In the 1,000 years that
  followed, Clontarf has grown and thrived into a modern urban centre, yet tranquil
  and proud of its heritage. In this work, best-selling author Joe Curtis explores
  that history in an accessible, visual narrative, including archive photographs,
  postcards and records.
