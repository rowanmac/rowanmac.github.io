abstract: "If you know nothing about County Wexford, or know a lot, this book is equally\
  \ appealing. County Wexford is commonly regarded as an anglicised county on the\
  \ east coast of Ireland. Gaelic Wexford shatters that stereotype and presents an\
  \ entirely fresh take on the history of the County, but written for the first time\
  \ from an Irish language and Gaelic perspective. Three quarters of Wexford\u2019\
  s recorded history was lived entirely through Irish rather than English: yet that\
  \ history has been silenced and invisibilised.\_\_Here in 450 pages, 400 colour\
  \ illustrations, and four thousand footnotes, Wexford Is presented in an entirely\
  \ new light. Fresh archival discoveries from libraries all over the world unveil\
  \ Wexford in ways that have never been recorded before.\_Here for the first time,\
  \ are detailed treatments of the quintessential Wexford families the Murphys, Doyles,\
  \ Bolgers, Breens, Dorans, Keoghs, Kinsellas, Kavanaghs, and many more. The book\
  \ offers a treasure trove of new genealogical sources - like a detailed listing\
  \ by townland of over a thousand Wexford people in 1641, to vibrant portraits of\
  \ colourful personalities: it also has a series of\_ freshly\_ recovered historical\
  \ maps, including north Wexford in 1657 and a superb estate map from 1729 that covers\
  \ the area from Enniscorthy to Wexford and new discoveries like the earliest drawing\
  \ of the Hook lighthouse from 1730\_This volume explores the hidden history of Wexford:\
  \ from big themes like its oak woods, coastline, and farmlands, to vivid vignettes\
  \ of windmills, rabbit warrens, wolves and dovecots. It also offers detailed treatments\
  \ of the history of Wexford, New Ross and Enniscorthy.\_This book offers a bold\
  \ reimagining of the history of a remarkable county with a distinctive history and\
  \ culture."
