abstract: "The British Isles hold a unique position in the history of art, a place\
  \ where local traditions fuse with international ideas in extraordinary waysAt once\
  \ isolated by coastal boundaries, yet also part of larger networks of diverse peoples,\
  \ these islands have always benefited from a dual perspective. Artistic creativity\
  \ in the British Isles stretches back to Ice Age engravings of reindeer, horses\
  \ and birds. International networks were already shaping prehistoric art and by\
  \ 1,000 CE artists working in Britain and Ireland were using lapis lazuli from Afghanistan,\
  \ walrus tusks from Greenland, garnets from India and elephant ivory from Africa.\
  \ The Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings and Normans introduced new styles from overseas,\
  \ as did later European artists, attracted by the wealth of royal courts. Art was\
  \ traded and looted across the British empire by colonial explorers, merchants and\
  \ the military. In the course of the 20th century these islands have been a refuge,\
  \ but also a place where migrants have faced resistance. Sculptures by Jewish immigrants\
  \ fleeing Nazi death camps, paintings by post-war Caribbean artists and protest\
  \ murals sparked by the Troubles in Northern Ireland all express artists\u2019 complex\
  \ relationships with the idea of home. Artists today such as Grayson Perry, Lubaina\
  \ Himid, Yinka Shonibare, Rachel Whiteread and Edmund de Waal consciously reflect\
  \ on this long history in their work, exploring concepts of identity and belonging.\
  \ Fresh, pacy and surprising,\_The Art Isles\_tells the story of why art in Britain\
  \ and Ireland is so rich and dynamic \u2013 and why it has always extended far beyond\
  \ geographical borders."
