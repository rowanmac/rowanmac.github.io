abstract: "Award-winning journalist and bestselling author Martin Dillon returns to\
  \ shine a light on the role of women in the Troubles, amplifying voices long silenced\
  \ by the din of history.Through raw and compelling testimonies from both sides of\
  \ the community, Dillon explores the overlooked perspectives of women whose lives\
  \ were impacted by the brutal conflict. Some were directly involved in violence\
  \ as members of paramilitary organisations. Many witnessed the ruthless murders\
  \ of family members. All were profoundly and irrevocably affected by the violence\
  \ and its aftermath.Former IRA volunteers, the wife of notorious UDA Commander Stevie\
  \ \u2018Top Gun\u2019 McKeag, a survivor of the 1974 Dublin bombings and the daughter\
  \ of a murdered judge share their stories among many others, their words reverberating\
  \ with the intensity of their experiences.Dillon also unmasks the shadowy dealings\
  \ of British intelligence and the impact of collusion on unsolved murders, exposing\
  \ the layers of deception that have haunted families and communities.The Sorrow\
  \ and the Loss is an eye-opening exploration of the previously unwritten history\
  \ of the Troubles, challenging readers to confront the harsh realities of a conflict\
  \ where truth and justice remain elusive."
