abstractNote: There is much to learn from modern left-wing activism in Ireland. A rich tapestry of movements, including republicans, social democrats, trade unions, Trotskyists and anarchists, they have been battling neoliberalism and austerity with vigour, frustration, success and failure.Fragments of Victory charts these political currents, from the difficult early years of anti-austerity campaigning, to the successful mass campaign to end water charges and prevent water privatisation, and the seismic victory that was 'Repeal' - the campaign for women’s reproductive rights. Looking to the present, the campaign around the brutal housing crisis is also addressed.Each chapter covers a different campaign or group, written by leading activists who provide insiders' perspectives on how history was made, and share valuable insights that can be applied to international movements everywhere.
