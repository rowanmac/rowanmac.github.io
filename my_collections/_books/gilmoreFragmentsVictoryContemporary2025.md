abstract: "There is much to learn from modern left-wing activism in Ireland. A rich\
  \ tapestry of movements, including republicans, social democrats, trade unions,\
  \ Trotskyists and anarchists, they have been battling neoliberalism and austerity\
  \ with vigour, frustration, success and failure.Fragments of Victory charts these\
  \ political currents, from the difficult early years of anti-austerity campaigning,\
  \ to the successful mass campaign to end water charges and prevent water privatisation,\
  \ and the seismic victory that was 'Repeal' - the campaign for women\u2019s reproductive\
  \ rights. Looking to the present, the campaign around the brutal housing crisis\
  \ is also addressed.Each chapter covers a different campaign or group, written by\
  \ leading activists who provide insiders' perspectives on how history was made,\
  \ and share valuable insights that can be applied to international movements everywhere."
