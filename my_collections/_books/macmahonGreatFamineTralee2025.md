abstract: Bryan MacMahon focuses on human stories rather than statistics as he depicts
  the unprecedented events, upheavals and challenges of the famine years through the
  eyes of those who were there and reveals information which has lain hidden and untapped
  for 170 years. This book gives an account of incidents in Tralee and North Kerry.
  It gives a detailed overview and a moving insight into the suffering endured by
  thousands in the area. The contemporary accounts allow the reader to relive the
  shocking events, and to understand the stark dilemmas faced by those who were not
  themselves directly affected by hunger or disease. Here too are the names and inquest
  details of some of the dead, and poignant descriptions of life in the workhouses
  of Tralee and Listowel. Included are stories of scandals and possible sexual abuse
  in the workhouse but also many examples of selfless humanitarian work.
