abstract: "An absorbing study of the development and reception of musical culture\
  \ in Ireland by a pioneering and deservedly renowned author. This volume is a collection\
  \ of fourteen essays on the history and reception of Irish music and music in Ireland.\
  \ It addresses three prevailing themes: the historiography of Irish music, the influence\
  \ of music on Irish writing (and vice versa), and the cultural identity and reception\
  \ of Irish music both domestically and in the world at large. Its principal protagonists\
  \ include Thomas Moore, W. H. Grattan Flood, George Moore, Edward Martyn, Charles\
  \ Villiers Stanford, James Joyce, Dora Peja\u010Devi\u0107, Ina Boyle, Aloys Fleischmann\
  \ and Jennifer Walshe. These essays also identify and interrogate key questions\
  \ underpinning a general crisis of reception in relation to Irish music, and particularly\
  \ art music, within the domain of Irish studies. Fieldwork examines this crisis\
  \ in the aftermath of The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland (published in 2013)\
  \ and a major retrospective of Irish art music, Composing the Island (curated and\
  \ presented in 2016). It thereby engages closely with contemporary Irish art music\
  \ and the challenges which this music has faced in the early decades of the twenty-first\
  \ century. This well-conceived and beautifully written work testifies to Harry White's\
  \ central place in the shaping of the discourse surrounding the cultural history\
  \ of Irish music over the last 40 years. White's gift for expression and memorably\
  \ poetic turns of phrase allows the complexity of ideas and range of historical\
  \ and literary knowledge examined in these essays to be deftly excavated and evaluated.\
  \ Curiosity, provocativeness, imagination and literature are threaded through his\
  \ exploration of how Irish history and experience have been imagined musically."
