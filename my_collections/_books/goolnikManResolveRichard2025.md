abstract: "A fascinating, well-illustrated and internationally researched biography\
  \ of Richard Henry Brunton, a talented civil engineer in the nineteenth century\
  \ and a proud representative of his profession in a rapidly changing world. Brunton\
  \ was born in Muchalls, Aberdeenshire and initially worked on railway line development.\
  \ He then came to prominence as Chief Engineer to the Japanese Government when the\
  \ country was forced to \u201Dopen up\u201D. As well as eventually supervising the\
  \ building of 26 Western-style tower lighthouses along with various other navigational\
  \ initiatives, he additionally established a groundbreaking staff training and technical\
  \ complex for this move. Furthermore, he also took a lead in town planning of the\
  \ chief trading settlement of Yokohama, and in other matters too. Returning to the\
  \ United Kingdom, Brunton eventually became manager of a large petrochemical plant\
  \ in the central \u2018belt\u2019 of Scotland, getting involved as well with working\
  \ man\u2019s\u2019 broader education and then, moving back south, took over an architectural\
  \ ornaments business in London. The company won prizes and worked at home and around\
  \ the globe. Unfortunately, although extensive, the work was over-stressful and\
  \ he over-dipped into its income to the extent he was declared personally bankrupt.\
  \ However, one of his theatrical clients, based in Ireland, approached him to become\
  \ their architect and there he created three gems of theatre design, two of which,\
  \ in the cities of Dublin and Cork, still successfully function."
