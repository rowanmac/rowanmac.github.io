abstract: "The book explores the symbiotic relationship between Irish migrants and\
  \ the built environment in England. In doing so the book draws out fresh aspects\
  \ of the migration story, how it was supported through the use of different types\
  \ of buildings and also demonstrates the opportunities that emigration offered to\
  \ Irish communities.When emigrants travelled from Ireland to England their first\
  \ connections with the country were not just with people, but also buildings. Buildings\
  \ that housed the institutions and businesses that formed the support network for\
  \ Irish people, many of them young and travelling alone.The themed chapters cover\
  \ public and private buildings that reflect the various working and social lives\
  \ of Irish people, including those that show the business acumen of migrants. It\
  \ also explores buildings that supported informal networks \u2013 churches, pubs\
  \ and community centres.And it documents buildings that demonstrate other sides\
  \ to the standard migration narrative that it was only the poor and low or semi-skilled\
  \ that migrated by looking at built heritage associated with Irish artists and workers\
  \ in the creative industries."
