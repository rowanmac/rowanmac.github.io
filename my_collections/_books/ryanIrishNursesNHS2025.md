abstract: From the inception of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, Irish women
  and men were actively recruited to train and work as nurses in British hospitals.
  By the 1960s approximately 30,000 Irish-born nurses were working across the NHS,
  constituting around 12% of all nursing staff. While many Irish families produced
  at least one nurse and many of those emigrated, so far there has been little recognition
  of the enormous contribution of Irish nurses to health care in Britain. Based on
  45 interviews, this book tells the stories of Irish nurses in their own words using
  rich oral history and photographs. From the rigours of training to the fun of dancehalls,
  the book explores their life experiences as nurses and also as Irish migrants in
  British society.
