abstract: '"The Nine Years War was one of the most traumatic and bloody conflicts
  in the history of Ireland. Encroachment on the liberties of the Irish lords by the
  English crown caused Hugh O''Neill, earl of Tyrone, to build an unprecedented confederation
  of Irish lords leading a new Irish military armed with pike and shot. This book
  is an important reassessment of the military dimensions of the Nine Years War, as
  situated in the wider context of European political and military history. Backed
  by Philip II of Spain, Tyrone and his allies outclassed the forces of the English
  crown, achieving a string of stunning victories and bringing the power of Elizabeth
  I in Ireland to the brink of collapse. The opening shots were fired in Ulster, but
  from 1593 to 1599 war engulfed all of Ireland. The conflic consumed the lives and
  reputations of Elizabeth''s court favourites as they struggled to cope with the
  new Irish way of war. Sophisticated strategy and modern tactics made the Irish war
  appear unwinnable to many in England, but Lord Mountjoy''s arrival as deputy in
  1600 changed everything. Mountjoy reformed the demoralized English army and rolled
  back the advances achieved by Tyrone. Mountjoy''s success was crowned by his shattering
  defeat of Tyrone and his Spanish allies at Kinsale in 1601, which ultimately led
  to the earl''s submission in 1603, though not before famine, misery and atrocity
  took their toll on the people of Ireland. This book rewrites the narrative and interpretation
  of the Nine Years War. It uses military evidence to show that not only was Irish
  society progressive, it was also quicker to adopt military and technological change
  than its English enemies."--'
