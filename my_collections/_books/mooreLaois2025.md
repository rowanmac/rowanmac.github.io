abstract: "The turbulent revolutionary period in modern Irish history from 1912 to\
  \ 1923 had a profound impact on the political, economic and social make-up of Laois.\
  \ The issue of land that had dominated the landscape of Laois from the late nineteenth\
  \ century onwards, continued to do so during the Irish revolutionary years, often\
  \ intertwined with the major political developments of the era. Cormac Moore\u2019\
  \ s book explores how seismic national events from the Third Home Rule Crisis, through\
  \ to the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising, the War of Independence and the\
  \ Civil War affected Laois. Moore\u2019 s book provides a comprehensive extensively\
  \ researched account of how the Irish Revolution impacted on all sections of Laois\
  \ society at the time, with its effects reverberating for years after."
