abstract: "Using extensive and fresh archival material, this book places the relationship\
  \ between the United Kingdom and Ireland after 1921 in a new light, encouraging\
  \ us to rethink the dominant narrative of conflict and strife. While the work does\
  \ not shy away from the clear points of dispute, it contends that these were far\
  \ from the full story.Clearly, partition and the Troubles seen from the late 1960s\
  \ onwards cast a long shadow, but disputes over Northern Ireland must be placed\
  \ alongside those successes seen elsewhere. Unpacking a variety of topics including\
  \ trade, tourism, the treatment of tuberculosis, and migration, this work covers\
  \ new ground in social and political history. It balances an analysis of high politics\
  \ \u2013 Cosgrave and de Valera on the one side and Baldwin and Attlee on the other\
  \ \u2013 with the actions of ordinary people \u2013 nurses, doctors, sports fans,\
  \ and labourers. The British\u2013Irish story is also placed in a wider context\
  \ through comparison with both countries\u2019 dealings with America and an outline\
  \ of their coordinated entry into the European Economic Community.This study will\
  \ be an ideal resource to both students and all those wishing to consider and re-examine\
  \ the fate of the United Kingdom, Ireland, and the British Empire."
