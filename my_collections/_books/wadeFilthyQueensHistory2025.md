abstractNote: In Filthy Queens, Dr Christina Wade looks at the history of beer alongside some of the biggest events in the story of Ireland. You’ll find 18th-century courtesans who had a wicked streak of beer snobbery and early medieval monks who wrote beer reviews so terrible any Untappd fan would feel right at home.   There will be beer tastings, parties, music and wakes. You’ll meet thieves and murderers, saints and goddesses. You’ll hear stories of kings and paupers, witches and bishops, Irish, English and Vikings from the Late Iron Age all the way up to the early 20th century. And don’t forget the rules, from medieval edicts about malt quality to early modern water regulations. Of course, there will be some marked differences, notably the human sacrifice. And the zombies.  Throughout the book, Christina also makes connections to tangible links to the past, whether it’s buildings that still dot the landscape, artefacts in museums, things you pass on your daily commute or the pint glass you drink out of. We’ve been drinking beer for millennia, so it’s a perfect way to embrace the past and those who lived in it. In the end, you’ll see that the history of beer is intimately intertwined with the history of us.
