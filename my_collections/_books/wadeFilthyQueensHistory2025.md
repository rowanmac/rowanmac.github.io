abstract: "In Filthy Queens, Dr Christina Wade looks at the history of beer alongside\
  \ some of the biggest events in the story of Ireland. You\u2019ll find 18th-century\
  \ courtesans who had a wicked streak of beer snobbery and early medieval monks who\
  \ wrote beer reviews so terrible any Untappd fan would feel right at home.   There\
  \ will be beer tastings, parties, music and wakes. You\u2019ll meet thieves and\
  \ murderers, saints and goddesses. You\u2019ll hear stories of kings and paupers,\
  \ witches and bishops, Irish, English and Vikings from the Late Iron Age all the\
  \ way up to the early 20th century. And don\u2019t forget the rules, from medieval\
  \ edicts about malt quality to early modern water regulations. Of course, there\
  \ will be some marked differences, notably the human sacrifice. And the zombies.\
  \  Throughout the book, Christina also makes connections to tangible links to the\
  \ past, whether it\u2019s buildings that still dot the landscape, artefacts in museums,\
  \ things you pass on your daily commute or the pint glass you drink out of. We\u2019\
  ve been drinking beer for millennia, so it\u2019s a perfect way to embrace the past\
  \ and those who lived in it. In the end, you\u2019ll see that the history of beer\
  \ is intimately intertwined with the history of us."
