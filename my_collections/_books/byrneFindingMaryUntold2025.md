abstract: During a robbery on 10 March 1844, 14-year-old servant Mary Doherty was
  murdered in a farmhouse near Culdaff, Co. Donegal. There was no doubt locally about
  the perpetrator's identity, but there was insufficient evidence against Daniel McKeeny,
  and he was eventually transported for a separate offence of sheep-stealing. Based
  on original research, this book reconstructs the world of a north Donegal village
  on the eve of the Great Famine to explore the approaches to justice taken by the
  local community and agents of the state, and examines the survival of the murder
  in local folklore to reflect on memory, remembrance and whose stories get to be
  told.
