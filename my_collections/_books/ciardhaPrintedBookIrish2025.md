abstract: '"The Oxford History of the Irish Book, Volume II: The Printed Book in Irish,
  1567-2010s is the second volume in Oxford''s signature, five-volume History of the
  Irish Book series. With eighty-two chapters by seventy leading commentators on,
  and participants in, Irish book history, this volume spans almost five hundred years
  of Irish-language book printing, production, publication, distribution, and reception.
  It begins with the 1567 publication of John Carswell''s Gaelic version of the Book
  of Common Order and follows the story of the printed book (and journalism) in Irish
  into the twenty-first century, the internet, ebooks, and other formats. This volume
  covers religious publications from the sixteenth to eighteenth century, competing
  versions of Irish history, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century texts which reflected
  an ''antiquarian'' interest in Ireland and its culture, ongoing literary production
  in the nineteenth century, printers, publishers, literacy, books and volumes produced
  by learned societies interested in Irish language and culture, Gaelic Revival publications,
  post-Independence literature and its publishers, journalism from the late eighteenth
  to twenty-first century, lexicography, nonfiction, educational publishing, folklore
  and place lore, translation, the contribution of scholars from outside Ireland,
  publishing in the Irish diaspora, typography, book design and illustration, the
  reception of Irish-language texts (from censorship to bestseller status), book collection,
  and, finally, sources for the study of Irish book history"--'
