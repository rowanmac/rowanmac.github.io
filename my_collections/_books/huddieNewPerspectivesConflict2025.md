abstract: "Conflict is a well-trod theme in the study of nineteenth-century Ireland\
  \ and \u2018the Irish\u2019. While this is especially clear in the more traditional\
  \ fields of politics, religion and the military, conflict was equally manifest in\
  \ every arena of Irish people\u2019s lives, both in Ireland and abroad, including\
  \ in areas such as gender, class, culture and identity in domestic or personal spaces,\
  \ institutional life, education and medicine. Yet, despite a broad and multi-disciplinary\
  \ historiography, this is the first book to focus solely on this rich theme.New\
  \ Perspectives on Conflict and Ireland in the Nineteenth Century brings together\
  \ a group of scholars based around the world and in multiple disciplines who engage\
  \ with the manifestations, representations and histories of conflict pertaining\
  \ to Ireland and Irish people throughout the long nineteenth century."
