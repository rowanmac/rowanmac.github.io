abstractNote: "During the nineteenth century, local officials sought to deal with\
  \ their Irish pauper \u2018problem\u2019 by removing these poor migrants back to\
  \ Ireland under the laws of settlement and removal. Over the course of the century,\
  \ hundreds of thousands of Irish paupers were forcibly repatriated in this way.\
  \ Even though the settlement rights of Irish immigrants gradually improved over\
  \ time, removals were still taking place into the twentieth century. The system\
  \ was widely recognised as being cruel and unfair, especially in Ireland where the\
  \ removal of Irish paupers from Britain garnered considerable political and press\
  \ attention. Much was made of the illegality of some removals, and of harsh removals\
  \ involving widowed women, children and the elderly. This book, which is the first\
  \ sustained study of repatriation from Britain, demonstrates a persistent theme:\
  \ the marginal nature of Irish life on the larger island. Drawing on extensive research\
  \ from newspaper sources and parliamentary papers, it presents an original and richly\
  \ detailed perspective on Irish immigration, poverty and pauperism in nineteenth-century\
  \ Britain."
