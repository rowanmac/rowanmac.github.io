abstract: Mitchelstown in Co. Cork was one of over 750 Irish towns built or remodelled
  between 1690 and 1840. Its regular street plan, linear building plots and uniform
  architecture epitomized the enlightened and improving mentality of the period. The
  town was largely built over a period of fifty years between 1779 and 1830, at a
  time of significant national and local economic expansion, creating opportunities
  for investors and builders to develop and speculate. This study examines not only
  the ambitions and influence of the proprietorial family, the Kings, earls of Kingston,
  who initiated the reconstruction of the town, but also those who engaged in building
  and developing it. These professionals, shopkeepers, clergymen and others had as
  much influence on its architecture and realization as had the proprietors.
