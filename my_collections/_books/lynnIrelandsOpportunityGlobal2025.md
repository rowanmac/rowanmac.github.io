abstract: "How the South African War transformed nationalist politics across Ireland\u2019\
  s global diasporaIn 1899, the British Empire embarked on a deeply controversial\
  \ war against two small Boer Republics in South Africa. To many Irish nationalists,\
  \ the Boers were fellow victims of British mistreatment. Defeat for the Boers, they\
  \ worried, would mean defeat for the principle that small, white nations like Ireland\
  \ were entitled to govern themselves. Widespread outrage sparked a dramatic resurgence\
  \ in Irish nationalism after a decade of disunity and decline.The shape and strength\
  \ of this revival varied throughout Ireland\u2019s vast global diaspora. Ireland\u2019\
  s Opportunity traces the impact of \u201CBoer fever\u201D across Ireland and the\
  \ diaspora networks that connected Irish communities in the United States, Canada,\
  \ Australia, and New Zealand.Home Rulers reunited to oppose the war, even as those\
  \ in Britain\u2019s colonies asserted their loyalty to the empire and its racist\
  \ underpinnings. Fenian revolutionaries, meanwhile, saw \u201CEngland\u2019s difficulty\u201D\
  \ in South Africa as \u201CIreland\u2019s opportunity\u201D to strike for independence.\
  \ Explosive conspiracies hatched in Ireland and the United States failed to kindle\
  \ the desired revolution. But the lessons and legacies of the South African War\
  \ years would shape their fateful response when \u201CEngland\u2019s difficulty\u201D\
  \ returned after 1914.Blending global perspectives with intimate portraits of individuals\
  \ whose lives were forever changed by the war, Shane Lynn reveals how Irish nationalism\
  \ was a global phenomenon with a tangled and paradoxical relationship to empire."
