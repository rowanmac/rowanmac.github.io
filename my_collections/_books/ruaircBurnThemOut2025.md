abstract: "In November 2023, the Dublin riots shocked Ireland and the wider world.\
  \ They were sparked by a knife attack by an immigrant on three children. Inflammatory\
  \ online rumours spread in minutes. Part of the north inner city were wrecked, cars\
  \ and buses torched, and protestors wreaked havoc on the streets for hours.Until\
  \ very recently, Ireland had prided itself on having escaped the wave of far-right,\
  \ xenophobic populism now rampant throughout Europe. That complacency has been rudely\
  \ challenged.In Burn Them Out!, P\xE1draig \xD3g \xD3 Ruairc explores the long history\
  \ that has led to this pivotal moment. He uncovers the pervasive anti-Semitism of\
  \ the Irish political elite in the 1920s and 30s, the energetic efforts of Mosley\
  \ and other British fascists to extend their movement to the North of Ireland, the\
  \ IRA's alliance with Nazi Germany in the 40s and the many ultra-Catholic, anti-communist\
  \ Irish movements that were millimetres away from fascism. He tells the story of\
  \ exotic entities like the Fascio di Dublino, the Dublin branch of Mussolini's Fascist\
  \ Party, and the Irish wing of Miss Rotha Lintorn-Orman's 'British Fascisti'. The\
  \ openly-fascist Irish movement known as the Blueshirts, an offshoot and ally of\
  \ the early Fine Gael, is looked at with fresh eyes, and its supporters' statements\
  \ about Jews now make for hair-raising reading. Many of its proponents went on to\
  \ become pillars of the Irish political and cultural establishment. And the Catholic\
  \ and nationalist Ailtir\xED na hAis\xE9irghe (Architects of the Resurrection),\
  \ a post-war sect, was in many ways a precursor of today's Irish far right.This\
  \ is an essential book about an aspect of Irish history all too often swept under\
  \ the carpet."
