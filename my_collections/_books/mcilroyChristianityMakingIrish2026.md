abstract: "For almost two millennia, the island of Ireland has continued to have an\
  \ impact on European and English-speaking Christianity and culture out of all proportion\
  \ to its size and position. This volume looks at key Irish figures, beyond lawyers\
  \ and judges, whose ideas have impacted on the way law is conceived, conceptualised,\
  \ and practised. The work consists of four Parts, each corresponding to a distinct\
  \ historical phase. During the Early Mediaeval Period, Christian influence was visible\
  \ both in Ireland\u2019s brehon legal system and in the treatises which Irish monks\
  \ wrote on subjects such as the law of war and how to rule as a Christian prince.\
  \ In the post-mediaeval period, the Protestant Ascendancy required defenders of\
  \ the new settlement, whose ideas would have ramifications for the colonisation\
  \ of the New World. We also find Ireland producing thinkers of international stature\
  \ such as Archbishop James Ussher, Bishop George Berkeley, and Edmund Burke, who\
  \ set a trend of Irish influence throughout the English-speaking world. The struggle\
  \ for independence in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries produced the\
  \ towering figures of Daniel O\u2019Connell, Edward Carson, and Eamon de Valera,\
  \ as well as Patrick Pearse, the lodestar of the Easter Rising in 1916. In the twentieth\
  \ century, great Irish men and women who influenced English-speaking culture include\
  \ C.S. Lewis, James Joyce, Richard O\u2019Sullivan KC, and Herbert McCabe. They\
  \ show the enduring importance of a commitment to reason and a desire for virtue\
  \ against the backdrop of the conflicts, both domestic and international, which\
  \ impacted Ireland. With contributions drawn from Irish, British, and North American\
  \ scholars and lawyers, the diversity of international and methodological perspectives\
  \ is a key strength of the volume. The book will appeal to scholars, lawyers, and\
  \ students interested in the history of ideas, the interplay between religion and\
  \ law, and Ireland as a place of contestation, experimentation, and generation of\
  \ new ideas."
