abstract: "This article demonstrates how the Women\u2019s International League (WIL)\
  \ dealt with the changing ideas of nationhood, internationalism, imperialism, and\
  \ freedom when supporting the cause of Irish independence. Their actions included\
  \ seeking to protect Britain\u2019s good name while simultaneously criticising that\
  \ very same nation for its war in Ireland. The \u2018small nations\u2019 rhetoric\
  \ that had emerged during the First World War was used by British feminists to divorce\
  \ the atrocities of the British Crown force, the Black and Tans, from the wider\
  \ colonial experience of oppression. Comparing the occupation of Ireland in 1919\u2013\
  1921 to that of Belgium during the First World War enabled British internationalist-feminists\
  \ to support the sovereignty of Ireland\u2019s nationhood, without necessarily having\
  \ to engage with the colonial dimension or history of the conflict. This entirely\
  \ changed the parameters within which British feminists could show solidarity with\
  \ the Irish republicans while still maintaining positive views of British imperialism\
  \ and the empire."
