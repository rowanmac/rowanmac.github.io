abstract: "This article explores the little-known response of the Irish Save the Children\
  \ Fund to famine in Soviet Russia and Ukraine from 1921, as well as to hunger in\
  \ the west of Ireland in 1924\u20135. Drawing on wide-ranging sources from the Cadbury\
  \ Research Library, the Women\u2019s Library at LSE and elsewhere, it examines the\
  \ translation of humanitarian relief into different local, national and transnational\
  \ contexts. The Volga famine was a seismic moment in inter-war humanitarianism and\
  \ the initial focus of the newly formed Irish Save the Children Fund, itself formed\
  \ in the context of war and civil war. Humanitarianism in the new Irish Free State\
  \ had distinctive gendered, class and religious dynamics, as well as connections\
  \ to Britain and the Irish diaspora. This article argues that tracing relatively\
  \ small and largely unexamined organisations like the Irish Save the Children Fund\
  \ offers new angles into the relationship between humanitarianism, nationhood and\
  \ social change."
