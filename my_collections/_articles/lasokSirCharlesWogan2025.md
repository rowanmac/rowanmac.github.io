abstract: "Sir Charles Wogan (1684\u20131754) was rewarded for engineering the rescue\
  \ of Clementina Sobieska in 1719 with a colonelcy in the Spanish Army and spent\
  \ most of his active career as a soldier in garrisons in Northern Spain. So far\
  \ as is known, his only experience of combat and, more particularly, experience\
  \ in command in an action, was in 1732 during the Spanish Oran campaign. The purpose\
  \ of this article is to explore that part of Wogan\u2019s military career, focusing\
  \ upon one incident in the Oran campaign in which Wogan played a leading role but\
  \ which led to the termination of his active involvement in the campaign because\
  \ of a wound that he received during the incident and, ultimately, led to his decision\
  \ to cease active service until his military career revived in 1745, when he was\
  \ promoted to brigadier-general and put in command of a contingent of Irish officers\
  \ sent to France to join Prince Charles Edward Stuart."
