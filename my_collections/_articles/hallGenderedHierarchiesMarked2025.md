abstract: Detailed legal and court records of household and personal violence do not
  survive from early modern Ireland in sufficient numbers to allow for statistical
  analysis. However, close reading of selected court narratives about violence between
  householders allows analysis of the contested contemporary meanings of violence.
  In their descriptions, witnesses read the marks on injured bodies and interpreted
  their meanings according to gendered hierarchies of power within households. This
  article uses such narratives to analyse interpersonal violence between members of
  families and households in early modern Ireland.
