abstractNote: "This paper presents an edition of a mid-seventeenth century poem composed\
  \ by P\xE1draig \xD3g Mac an Bhaird in praise of Maol Muire Mac Suibhne (son of\
  \ Donnchadh, son of Maol Muire), of the Mac Suibhne na dTuath family of North Donegal.\
  \ Maol Muire was an active participant in the war that started in 1641 in Ireland.\
  \ The poet describes the hardship caused by the conflict and praises Maol Muire\u2019\
  s military efforts. An apologue compares him to C\xFA Chulainn fighting alone to\
  \ protect Ulster. This is the only extant poem composed for Maol Muire. The poem\
  \ is edited here from Stonyhurst College MS A II 20, with readings from Trinity\
  \ College Dublin MS H 6. 7 (1411) and British Library MS Egerton 112. A diplomatic\
  \ edition of the text from the Trinity College Dublin manuscript has previously\
  \ been published in ABM (133)."
