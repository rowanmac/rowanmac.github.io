abstract: "An I.R.B. supreme council member and the I.R.A. 2nd Northern Division commandant,\
  \ Charlie Daly was executed at Drumboe on 14 March 1923. Daly\u2019s case shows\
  \ how, through I.R.B. auspices, Free State G.H.Q. planned a joint northern offensive\
  \ with republicans to avert civil war, while deploying the resources of the new\
  \ state (and false promises) to engineer the support or at least neutrality of the\
  \ Northern I.R.A. Eoin O\u2019Duffy and Richard Mulcahy connived to remove Daly\
  \ from his command because of his opposition to the Treaty, with events coming to\
  \ a head at the \u2018Beggar\u2019s Bush inquiry\u2019 on 2 March 1922. In due course,\
  \ the Free State elite killed every senior republican brother party to the northern\
  \ intrigue, including Joe McKelvey and Daly, the latter of whom was shot alongside\
  \ Se\xE1n Larkin from Derry \u2014 a witness to GHQ \u2018crookedness\u2019 the\
  \ previous March."
