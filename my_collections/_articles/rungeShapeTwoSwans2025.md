abstract: ", abstract:, This paper considers two cases of women able to transform\
  \ into swans in the medieval Irish texts Aided Derbforgaill and Aislinge \xD3enguso.\
  \ Using frameworks from trans studies and animal studies, it seeks to explore the\
  \ differences in outcome for the two women, with Derbforgaill dying after rejection\
  \ from humans and C\xE1er flying away with \xD3engus. The paper first considers\
  \ how the women are similar, before turning to the differences between them, and,\
  \ in particular, the disparity between their fates. This is explored through the\
  \ idea of \u2018species panic\u2019, which suggests that figures depicted as being\
  \ between species can destabilise the species status of those around them. I argue\
  \ that this lens shows that Derbforgaill dies because her ability to transform between\
  \ species leads her to become an outsider to a human community, while C\xE1er survives\
  \ because she is always situated within a network of Otherworld beings like herself.\
  \ This leads to a conclusion about one reason transformation stories are so prevalent\
  \ within medieval Irish literature: because they provide a method of exploring social\
  \ relationships in a legendary setting."
