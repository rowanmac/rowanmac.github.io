abstract: "This article looks at military history through a social lens, focusing\
  \ on the identity and experiences of the Irish Catholics recruited for service in\
  \ the British army during the American Revolution, a conflict which occurred before\
  \ Catholics were legally permitted to serve, but during which significant numbers\
  \ were recruited nonetheless. Using Irish Catholic recruitment and subsequent service\
  \ in the 46th Regiment of Foot as a case study, this article will discuss the integration\
  \ of this group into a regular regiment on the British establishment, arguing that\
  \ despite contemporary anxieties to the contrary, the incorporation of Irish Catholics\
  \ into the British army happened smoothly and without negative impact on regimental\
  \ cohesion and discipline. They became well-integrated, and while their loyalty\
  \ to the British state can never be definitively proven, they certainly became effective\
  \ participants in its army and empire. This provides a compelling viewpoint from\
  \ which to discuss the integration of \u2018others\u2019 into Britishness and the\
  \ imperial apparatus during this period."
