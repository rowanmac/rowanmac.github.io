abstract: "This paper traces the textual afterlife of Frederic William Burton\u2019\
  s 1840 watercolour A Blind Girl at A Holy Well to consider how periodicals and writers\
  \ deployed the painting\u2019s sentimental depiction of blindness as part of mid-century\
  \ debates about Irish culture and nationhood. While the publications all agreed\
  \ that the painting was emotionally moving and nationally significant, the character\
  \ of those emotions and the definition of that nation differed according to each\
  \ periodical\u2019s political and religious aims, suggesting a flexible link in\
  \ Victorian print culture between blindness and Irishness."
