abstract: "The end of the nineteenth century saw the emergence of nationalism as the\
  \ primary ideological underpinning of Australian identity, defining the broader\
  \ Australian people as a culturally British, Protestant community. Such developments\
  \ drew strength from key events of the early twentieth century, such as Australian\
  \ federation and the Great War. Although historians have conceded that Irish Australians\
  \ could adhere to the cultural tenets of Anglo-Australia, they have overlooked the\
  \ extent to which Irish-Australian Catholics, especially those from the middle class,\
  \ adopted Britishness as an integral part of their ethno-religious identity. Middle-class\
  \ Catholic individuals, families and groups negotiated the extent of their Irishness\
  \ to suit their needs within economic, social and cultural spaces dominated by Australia\u2019\
  s Protestant majority. This article argues that the expression of Britishness was\
  \ an intrinsic part of Catholics\u2019 middle-class ambitions, as they sought to\
  \ rectify their implicit \u2018otherness\u2019 in an Australia committed to a myth\
  \ of national unity on non-Irish, and non-Catholic, terms."
