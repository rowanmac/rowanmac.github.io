abstract: "For decades, transnational knowledge circulation in relation to schooling\
  \ in Ireland has been a neglected area of study among historians. This paper provides\
  \ new insights through a transnational lens on primary, secondary, and vocational\
  \ curriculum developments in the first decade following the advent of national independence\
  \ in the country in 1922. During this period, key policy-makers largely rejected\
  \ progressive educational ideas circulating internationally and promoted curricula\
  \ and pedagogy in primary and secondary schools that reflected the new nation\u2019\
  s deeply conservative Catholic nature and nationalist ethos. While initial signs\
  \ indicated that developments in vocational education might head in a different\
  \ direction, ultimately, more progressive educational ideas circulating internationally\
  \ were excluded from that sector as well. At all levels of the education system,\
  \ the hegemony of the Catholic Church and other contextual factors resulted in traditional\
  \ and conservative curricula that underpinned policy and practice until the 1960s."
