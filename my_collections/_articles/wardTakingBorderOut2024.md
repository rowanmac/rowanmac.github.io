abstractNote: "This article examines governing tactics which, prima facie, seek to\
  \ remove issues from political contestation, yet utilise democracy in doing so.\
  \ It explores this tension through the case of the 1973 Northern Ireland border\
  \ poll. In the context of escalating violence and entrenched political conflict,\
  \ the Heath government announced the poll alongside direct rule to \u2018take the\
  \ border out of politics\u2019. Although the poll was consistently framed in terms\
  \ of depoliticisation, it was increasingly viewed by both the government and the\
  \ public as a means to reassure the unionist community of Northern Ireland\u2019\
  s status in the United Kingdom. This attempt to reassure the unionists exposed the\
  \ political character of the strategy, strengthening the nationalist boycott campaign.\
  \ However, this article argues that in reconfiguring legitimacy for the United Kingdom,\
  \ the poll temporarily defused unionist concerns and allowed the UK government to\
  \ claim Northern Irish citizens had a democratic right to self-determination."
