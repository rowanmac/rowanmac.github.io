abstractNote: "Scribes of Irish manuscripts used a variety of symbols to assist their\
  \ readers by clarifying the layout of text on the page or by drawing attention to\
  \ significant textual or codicological matters. While many of these take the form\
  \ of standard technical signs, some scribes used ornamental symbols which are worthy\
  \ of further examination as they may be of diagnostic significance for the identification\
  \ of hands, schools or scribal networks. Reader\u2019s aids such as manicules can\
  \ also provide evidence of Ireland\u2019s engagement with a wider European scribal\
  \ culture."
