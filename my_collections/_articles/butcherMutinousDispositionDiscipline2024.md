abstractNote: "The fencible regiments of the 1790s operated like the regulars but\
  \ were limited to serve only in wartime, like the militia, and only in Scotland,\
  \ later becoming the British Isles. These restrictions were the primary cause of\
  \ the 1794 \u2018mutinies\u2019. These events, alongside other incidents of poor\
  \ discipline across all ranks, have been previously used to portray the fencibles\
  \ poorly. This article will argue that the \u2018mutinies\u2019 and the wider interactions\
  \ within the military justice system both demonstrate the \u2018soldier as worker\u2019\
  \ approach and how the inherent temporary nature of the fencibles fundamentally\
  \ shaped the employment of fencible officers and men."
