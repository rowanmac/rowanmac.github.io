abstract: 'Originally given as the Eolas Lecture at the International Congress on
  Medieval Studies at Kalamazoo in 2023, this exploratory essay poses two overlapping
  questions: did medieval Irish intellectuals think about "ethics" (as distinct from
  "morality," say, or "law") in ways that can be traced in our surviving sources;
  and what are the ethical standards to which we might hold ourselves in medieval
  Irish studies, as a modern academic discipline, in relation to issues such as publication,
  reviewing, our approach to sources, and how we interact with each other? Ethics,
  as a philosophical sub-discipline, encompasses many aspects of human behavior, past
  and present, and this essay suggests that it is essential, both individually as
  scholars and collectively as a discipline, to think about how we can write ethically,
  review ethically, and participate ethically in academic life. It also argues that
  we can indeed see a strand of thinking about ethics in medieval Ireland, and that
  further work is required to disentangle it from other established frameworks for
  understanding the actions of individuals.'
