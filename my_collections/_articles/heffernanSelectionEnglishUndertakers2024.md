abstract: In 1610, just over fifty men were granted hundreds of thousands of acres
  of land as part of the estates allocated to English undertakers in the Ulster Plantation
  in the counties of Armagh, Cavan, Donegal, Fermanagh and Tyrone. Exactly who these
  individuals were and why they were given estates remains understudied. This article
  closely explores the process whereby lands were petitioned for by consortiums of
  individuals in 1609 and early 1610, before assessing who, from amongst the well
  over 100 applicants, were actually granted lands. Where possible, it considers the
  background of many these individuals, their ties to the court and officials in England
  and Ireland, and their material resources. It also highlights how the applicants
  for lands who had the greatest financial means to make a success of it were generally
  ignored in favour of petitioners whose ability, from a material perspective, to
  implement the articles of plantation was highly dubious, something which many senior
  officials, such as the viceroy of Ireland, Arthur Chichester, had been anxious to
  avoid.
