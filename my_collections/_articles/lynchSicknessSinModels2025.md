abstract: "The contemporary LGBTQ+ history of Northern Ireland has emerged relatively\
  \ recently. This article examines two negative models that fed into understandings\
  \ of male homosexuality between the early 1960s and the end of the 1980s, and some\
  \ of the discourses that emanated from them. Using contemporary comment, theological\
  \ and medical writings, and oral history testimonies, this article charts the fortunes\
  \ of models of \u2018sickness\u2019 and \u2018sinfulness\u2019. A campaign to secure\
  \ law reform in the 1970s forced churches to confront the \u2018problem\u2019 of\
  \ homosexuality. I demonstrate the complexity of responses from two major Protestant\
  \ churches, the tentative emergence of a challenge from radical Christians and how\
  \ this landscape has been obscured by the notoriety of an infamous fundamentalist\
  \ campaign. As was the case in England, the notion of homosexuality as a pathology\
  \ gained traction in Northern Ireland only in the 1950s and 1960s, leading to medical\
  \ conversion practices, such as aversion therapy, which attempted to \u2018cure\u2019\
  \ men of same-sex desire. However, discourses conflicted, with regional social conditions\
  \ resulting in \u2018sickness\u2019 co-existing uneasily with \u2018sin\u2019. And\
  \ although it was opposed by a strain of evangelical thought, social conditions\
  \ fostered by conservative religiosity enabled pathologisation to linger on through\
  \ the 1980s."
