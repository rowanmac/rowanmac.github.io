abstract: "This paper is a review of existing sources across disciplines focusing\
  \ on the topic of female farm ownership. Throughout the centuries, females have\
  \ been explicitly excluded from owning and prevented from inheriting land. The purpose\
  \ of this paper is to examine historical customs and rules governing female land\
  \ ownership in Ireland and to demonstrate how the \u2018old\u2019 laws and customs\
  \ have contributed significantly to the patriarchal system of farm ownership that\
  \ is still in existence today even though the gender-based laws have disappeared.\
  \ This paper argues that a contributing factor to the current male-dominated farm\
  \ ownership figures is the normalisation of patriarchy by way of the old, gendered\
  \ laws and practices. Although gender discrimination is no longer acceptable in\
  \ such a direct legal form, the tradition and culture that established and supported\
  \ such customs can still be seen today, as males account for 87% of Irish farmholders.\
  \ This research addresses a lacuna in our understanding of women\u2019s unequal\
  \ position when it comes to the ownership of farms in Ireland."
