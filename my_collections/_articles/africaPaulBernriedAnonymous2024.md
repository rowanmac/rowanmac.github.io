abstract: "The continental recension of the vita of the sixth-century Irish saint\
  \ \xCDte survives only in five independent manuscript witnesses of the Magnum Legendarium\
  \ Austriacum [MLA], a vast, sprawling collection of hagiographical texts culled\
  \ from a great variety of sources in the late twelfth century. The recension is\
  \ anonymous in all five witnesses, but internal and circumstantial evidence points\
  \ to Paul of Bernried (c. 1080 - c. 1145) as the reviser of this vita. Paul was\
  \ an Augustinian canon best known for his Life of Pope Gregory VII (1073-85) which\
  \ also survives in the MLA. The most likely reason for his interest in this early\
  \ Irish saint is the affinity he saw between her and the Bavarian holy woman Herlucca\
  \ of Bernried (c. 1060-1127/8) whom he knew and revered. Although separated by space\
  \ and time, \xCDte and Herlucca provided a common spiritual model that resonated\
  \ with Paul despite his support for a Gregorian reform movement tainted by misogyny."
