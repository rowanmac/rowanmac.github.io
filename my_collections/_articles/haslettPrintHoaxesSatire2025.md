abstract: "Among the many ephemeral publications printed in Dublin at the height of\
  \ the Wood\u2019s halfpence affair is the anonymously authored A Letter from the\
  \ Grand Mistress of the Female Free-Masons to Mr Harding the Printer (Dublin: John\
  \ Harding, 1724). This was one of many satires of the Freemasons published in the\
  \ early 1720s. Its framing references to Wood\u2019s halfpence locate it in relation\
  \ to that affair, and its imaginative, if satirical, representation of a female\
  \ society can be situated in relation to other accounts of fictional female clubs\
  \ of the early century and to discussions of women\u2019s exclusion from Freemasonry\
  \ in particular and from club culture more generally. The pamphlet is known to survive\
  \ in only one copy but despite this ephemerality, its participation in the dynamic\
  \ world of relatively popular, cheap print in Dublin in the 1720s reveals much about\
  \ the nature of print culture and ideas of gender in this period. The essay uses\
  \ its readings and contextualizations of the pamphlet to argue that print hoaxes\
  \ and gender play \u2013 common comic modes in early eighteenth-century print culture,\
  \ and particularly in ephemeral pamphlets and broadsheets \u2013 permitted ideas\
  \ about women\u2019s roles and possibilities to be imaginatively explored. A transcription\
  \ of the Dublin 1724 printing, with a brief discussion of the question of its authorship,\
  \ follows as an appendix."
