abstract: "Achmet Borumborad's arrival in Ireland in the 1760s, during which he claimed\
  \ to be a Turk fleeing political persecution in Istanbul, quickly propelled him\
  \ to prominence, making him one of the country's most distinguished figures. His\
  \ published works and the establishment of a Turkish bath in Dublin, supported by\
  \ the Irish parliament, solidified his reputation. However, Achmet's good fortune\
  \ proved short-lived upon the discovery that he was, in fact, an Irishman. Consequently,\
  \ he retreated from the public eye, and his life story has become one of the most\
  \ widely known tales of corruption that contributed to the dissolution of the Irish\
  \ parliament. This paper explores the extraordinary account of Achmet through previously\
  \ unused documents, offering not only fascinating insights into social life in eighteenth-century\
  \ Ireland but also intriguing revelations regarding perceptions of the Ottoman Empire\
  \ and \u2018Turkish fashion\u2019 during this era."
