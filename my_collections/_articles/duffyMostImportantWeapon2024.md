abstractNote: "This article questions the prevailing historiographical view that the\
  \ approach of the Irish Free State to the Boundary Commission was lax and passive.\
  \ It argues that the Free State adopted a strategic and tactical approach, not as\
  \ a technicality to fulfil their Anglo-Irish Treaty obligations, but out of a genuine\
  \ desire for national union. The North-Eastern Boundary Bureau distributed publicity\
  \ demonstrating the wishes of the inhabitants and outlined international comparisons.\
  \ Officials visited Northern Ireland and Britain to ascertawin the views of stake-holders.\
  \ The suggestions for creating all-Ireland institutions as an alternative to the\
  \ commission show that the Free State leaders were motivated by a desire for \u2018\
  national union\u2019. The dissemination of publicity internationally, the bureau\u2019\
  s role in applying for League of Nations membership, and the registration of the\
  \ treaty at Geneva challenged potential British claims that the boundary was a domestic\
  \ matter and demonstrates consideration of a potential appeal to the league."
