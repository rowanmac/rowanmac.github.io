abstractNote: "Dr John Hill is considered to have produced the first biography of\
  \ Sterne, printed in a magazine in early 1760. This Note re-examines the provenance\
  \ of this piece and the role it has played in accounts of Sterne\u2019s early reception.\
  \ In doing so, it encourages a reassessment of the wider significance of newspapers\
  \ and magazines in constructing that reception history."
