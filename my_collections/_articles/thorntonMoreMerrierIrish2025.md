abstract: "This paper examines the occurrence of bishops of Irish dioceses among the\
  \ \ngrantors of so-called \u2018collective indulgences\u2019 at Avignon between\
  \ 1322 and 1363 \nand attempts to demonstrate how these indulgences can facilitate\
  \ our knowledge \nof the episcopate in Ireland during the fourteenth century. Over\
  \ 140 references \nto Irish bishops have been collected and are discussed, along\
  \ with twenty occurrences of bishops from Scotland for the same period, plus a handful\
  \ of Scottish \nand Welsh bishops named in indulgences from the late thirteenth\
  \ century. The \npaper discusses the nature of the Avignon collective indulgences\
  \ and uses these \ndocuments to help reconstruct the movements and careers of the\
  \ Irish prelates \nin question. The second part of the paper offers a more detailed\
  \ consideration \nof the controversial bishopric of Annaghdown during the first\
  \ half of the fourteenth century, in the light of the testimony of the indulgences.\
  \ This case study \nalso highlights problems relating to the collective indulgences\
  \ as primary sources \nthemselves, including their reliability. An appendix listing\
  \ the occurrences of \nIrish and Scottish bishops in collective indulgences is provided,\
  \ arranged by diocese, and additional data about individual bishops is provided\
  \ there."
