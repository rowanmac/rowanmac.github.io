abstract: "This article discusses how women teachers experienced the Irish revolutionary\
  \ period during the time of experience, rather than in the light of what came afterwards.\
  \ It argues that, while new scholarship generally succeeded in writing women into\
  \ the historical narrative of the revolutionary period, it failed to explore the\
  \ experiences of women teachers. The article draws on several archival collections,\
  \ to present an account of emotions of protest amongst women teachers, education\
  \ faculty and student teachers at Carysfort College Dublin. It also notes how convents\
  \ and convent school buildings were sometimes used as \u201Csafe houses\u201D and\
  \ presents archival evidence to support this finding."
