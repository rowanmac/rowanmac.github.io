abstract: "The Easter 1916 rebellion occasioned significant civilian casualties. Having\
  \ initially resisted the idea of compensating bereaved or injured civilians, the\
  \ British government relented by establishing the Rebellion (Victims\u2019) Committee\
  \ (RVC) which assessed 550 compensation applications for death and injury. Utilizing\
  \ these applications as well as Dublin Castle, Treasury, press, and parliamentary\
  \ records, this article examines five aspects of the state\u2019s treatment of civilian\
  \ casualties: why the government\u2019s initial opposition to compensation was eventually\
  \ reversed; the establishment of the RVC, the bureaucratic compensation process,\
  \ and the surveillance of working-class claimants; what the compensation claims\
  \ reveal about the nature and circumstances of civilian casualties during the rebellion;\
  \ how the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (1906) was used to determine compensation\
  \ awards and, consequently, how this minimized the state\u2019s financial liabilities\
  \ by treating civilian casualties not as victims of war but on a par with injured\
  \ workers; and, lastly, why the workmen\u2019s compensation legislation was an inadequate\
  \ means of treating civilian war casualties. The RVC compensation records enable\
  \ a unique case study of how the 1916 rebellion adversely affected the lives of\
  \ ordinary men, women and children, and how the British state endeavoured to limit\
  \ its obligations to make reparations to them."
