abstract: "The National Gallery of Ireland holds a portrait by Jean-Baptiste Perronneau\
  \ (1715\u201383) entitled Portrait of a Man and dated 1766. By cross-referencing\
  \ a number of material and historical clues, it is shown that the man portrayed\
  \ is none other than Jean-Gabriel Montaudouin (1722\u201381), a shipowner from Nantes,\
  \ Physiocrat and slave trader, author of a memoir of agriculture, arts, and commerce\
  \ (1756), which served as a model for the French agricultural societies of the late\
  \ eighteenth century."
