abstractNote: "This article examines the impact of changes to the practice of international\
  \ diplomacy in the first two decades of the 21st century on Ireland\u2019s Department\
  \ of Foreign Affairs, as the principal actor in Ireland\u2019s diplomacy and foreign\
  \ policy. These global changes could be categorised under three headings: actors,\
  \ issues and systems. Interviews were conducted with serving Irish dip- lomats to\
  \ obtain  their insights on, and assessments of, the increased com- plexity and\
  \ widening scope of Irish diplomacy. It was found that the DFA was strongly influenced\
  \ during the period 2000\u20132020 by international trends in the practice of diplomacy,\
  \ including the proliferation of state and non- state actors conducting international\
  \ relations, and the blurring of the dis- tinction between foreign and domestic\
  \ policies. From an operational perspective, developments in information and communications\
  \ technology and the rise of public diplomacy also had a major impact. A further\
  \ key development in the Irish case was the significant growth in the size of the\
  \ department in respect of both the number of missions and the number of staff.\
  \ Over the twenty-year period under review, the department was required to adapt\
  \ to both the evolving international context and to major internal organisational\
  \ change."
