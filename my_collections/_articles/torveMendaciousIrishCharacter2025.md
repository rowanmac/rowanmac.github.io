abstract: "This paper evaluates the prevalence and impact of nativist and anti-labor\
  \ narratives built on the claim that the \u2018Molly Maguires\u2019, a vague 1860s\
  \ and 70s militant Irish labor phenomenon of the Pennsylvania anthracite region,\
  \ was still active between the 1880s and the 1910s. It finds that such narratives\
  \ were widespread until the late 1890s, and still regionally significant until the\
  \ late 1900s, finally fading into obscurity in the 1910s. \u2018Molly Maguirism\u2019\
  \ as a media narrative was primarily directed at organized labor and the (Irish)\
  \ working class; it is best understood as a form of ethnicized proto-Red Scare tactic,\
  \ but could incorporate other elements, such as broader nativist ideology and sectarianism.\
  \ Based on these findings, prevailing models of Irish acculturation, such as Painter\u2019\
  s \u2018second enlargement of whiteness\u2019, are obsolete; the paper recommends\
  \ a thorough revision of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Irish American\
  \ working-class history, accounting for the continued and hitherto massively underestimated\
  \ presence of anti-Irish sentiment."
