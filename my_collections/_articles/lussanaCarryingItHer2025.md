abstract: "This article compares how early modern English travel accounts to Ireland,\
  \ America, and Africa portrayed native women. It examines gendered tropes that reoccurred\
  \ in all these writings, such as ease of childbirth, breast size, and breastfeeding\
  \ over the shoulder. It argues that many of these tropes that helped shape the racialised\
  \ thinking of indigenous people in America and Africa first appeared in English-written\
  \ travel accounts to Ireland. In some examples, English travel writers in America\
  \ and Africa made direct comparisons to Irish women. Accordingly, the article demonstrates\
  \ that Ireland is significant for the study of early modern English imperialism.\
  \ Perceptions of gender were central in formulating English racial perceptions of\
  \ the Other in the New World, but there was nothing unique about these tropes. In\
  \ other words, there was nothing particularly \u2018African\u2019 about English\
  \ perceptions of African women. English imperialists perceived Native American,\
  \ African, and Irish women through the same lens. The article shows that early modern\
  \ notions of racial difference were constructed less on overt characteristics particular\
  \ to a geographical zone of contact\u2014for example, the skin colour of Africans\u2014\
  and more on certain transferable gendered tropes that framed perceptions of native\
  \ women across all three continents."
