abstract: "Especially as regards Commonwealth restrictions, Ireland's immigration\
  \ policy has been seen as (surreptitiously) dependent on UK policy. Although the\
  \ Common Travel Area imposed serious limits, Irish discretion was in fact significant\
  \ and restrictive. In 1948\u20139 the United Kingdom secured Ireland's public commitment\
  \ to extend reciprocal citizenship rights to all the Commonwealth, notwithstanding\
  \ its secession, but Ireland avoided this vis-\xE0-vis the \u2018new\u2019 Commonwealth\
  \ and left its aliens exemption law deliberately opaque. Whilst broadly mirroring\
  \ the UK Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962, Ireland retained apartheid South Africa\
  \ as partially privileged and only comprehensively exempted British citizens born\
  \ within the United Kingdom. From 1973, the United Kingdom largely abandoned any\
  \ privileged treatment but, in entirely removing this in 1975 and selectively imposing\
  \ visas from 1976, Ireland went beyond even this. These divergences reflected that,\
  \ compared to the United Kingdom, it had left an increasingly diverse Commonwealth\
  \ in 1949 and had a stronger homogenous nationalism."
