abstract: "This article seeks to challenge dominant narratives surrounding the Great\
  \ Hunger in Ireland (An Gorta M\xF3r, 1845\u20131852) by focusing on the often-overlooked\
  \ aspect of marine resource exploitation. Traditional historiography of the famine\
  \ typically centres on the failure of the potato crop, British colonial policies\
  \ and the resulting socio-economic devastations. However, this narrative largely\
  \ omits the daily survival strategies and forms of resistance employed by the Irish\
  \ populace, particularly in their interaction with the marine environment. This\
  \ study explores how coastal communities turned towards the sea as a resource for\
  \ sustenance, autonomy and resistance against oppressive conditions imposed by the\
  \ crop failures and British colonial rule. By critically engaging with the role\
  \ of colonial control, external aid efforts and local resistance in primary accounts,\
  \ the authors argue that marine resources played an important role in the everyday\
  \ survival of Irish communities in the face of systemic failures."
