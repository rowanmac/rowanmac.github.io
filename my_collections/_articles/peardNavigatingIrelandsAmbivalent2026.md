abstract: "It was by chance that John Morrogh (1849\u20131901) became an imperial\
  \ player. Leaving Ireland as an almost penniless young man moulded by the Catholic\
  \ nationalism of the Christian Brothers, he joined the early diamond rush to Kimberley,\
  \ South Africa, and returned home twenty years later a director of Cecil Rhodes\u2019\
  s De Beers Consolidated Diamond Mines. He joined the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP)\
  \ and his diamond fortune eased his path to a seat in the House of Commons. As the\
  \ IPP fragmented, he took the side of the anti-Parnellite, Tim Healy, until he resigned\
  \ his seat and returned to Cork where he became an influential figure in business\
  \ and local government. This article traces the fortunes and sensibilities of an\
  \ Irish migrant who in many ways exemplifies Ireland\u2019s \u2018ambivalent heritage\u2019\
  \ of nationalism and empire.1"
