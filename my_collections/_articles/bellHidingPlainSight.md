abstract: "This article considers the persistent inattention to the activity of James\
  \ Joyce\u2019s female family members in supporting his creative and compositional\
  \ process. Using the discovery of the source for an early letter by Nora Barnacle\
  \ to James Joyce as the article\u2019s central example, it shows how Joyce scholarship\
  \ has inadvertently perpetuated misogynistic assumptions and overlooked the creative\
  \ labour of Joyce\u2019s female family members \u2013 especially Barnacle \u2013\
  \ in the composition of his works. Building on recent public engagement work by\
  \ Clare Hutton which highlights important archival documents penned by women who\
  \ supported Joyce, the present article instead returns to Joyce\u2019s published\
  \ archive to expose the overlooked labour of women in his letters and manuscript\
  \ drafts. In illuminating the practical and emotional tasks undertaken by Joyce\u2019\
  s wife, mother, aunt, daughter and daughter-in-law, this article elucidates the\
  \ personal network Joyce utilised variously to push publication opportunities, acquire\
  \ source and reading materials, and promote his public image."
