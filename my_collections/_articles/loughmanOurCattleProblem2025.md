abstract: "The 1930s was a period of profound crisis for Irish dry cattle farmers.\
  \ Understandably, many blamed the then Fianna F\xE1il government, which instigated\
  \ a trade dispute with Britain and harboured a deep aversion to the cattle trade.\
  \ In this context, many viewed the government's decision to reduce the cattle herd\
  \ in 1934 as part of a grand plan to upend largescale cattle farming. As this article\
  \ demonstrates, the situation was far more complex. The government certainly sought\
  \ to reform Irish agriculture but was unwilling to preside over the complete collapse\
  \ of the cattle trade. The Irish government's intransigence played a part, but the\
  \ worst years of the crisis also owed much to British protectionism. Yet, notwithstanding\
  \ the conditions, farmers stubbornly stuck to cattle."
