abstract: "From the beginning of 1969, panicked Irish diplomats based across the United\
  \ States beseeched Iveagh House, the headquarters for the Irish Department of Foreign\
  \ Affairs, to release an updated policy on raising Northern Ireland as an issue\
  \ at the United Nations Security Council. These requests resulted from an influx\
  \ of pressure from Irish Americans who were becoming increasingly concerned about\
  \ the unfolding situation in Northern Ireland. Following the heavily publicised\
  \ scenes from Derry on 5 October 1968, which showed police officers beating and\
  \ dragging civil rights protestors on the city\u2019s streets, Irish American interest\
  \ in the Northern Irish civil rights movement proliferated across the country and\
  \ across different sections of the diasporic community. While historians have found\
  \ that the Irish government neglected to effectively monitor the emerging civil\
  \ rights movement in Northern Ireland, Irish diplomats in the US paid careful attention\
  \ to how Irish Americans felt about and reacted to the nascent movement in Northern\
  \ Ireland from early on. Using government documents from the Irish Department of\
  \ Foreign Affairs, this article examines the reaction from the Irish embassy and\
  \ consulates to Irish American lobbying, analysing how factors such as class, political\
  \ ideology and attitudes towards national identity differentiated these responses.\
  \ This article argues that fissures in the relationship between the state and sections\
  \ of its diaspora in the US, which stemmed from divisions over the Irish Civil War,\
  \ contributed to the heightened sensitivity towards Irish American attitudes and\
  \ actions as tensions began to rise in Northern Ireland."
