abstract: "The list presented here forms a promptuarium or brief repository of detail\
  \ on the poets, writers and scholars from the territory historically known as Thomond\
  \ (Tuadhmhumhain). The list is neither exhaustive nor complete, but rather is a\
  \ circumscribed enumeration of entries that draw from references in the annals,\
  \ manuscripts and prose texts. The list is presented here in chronological form\
  \ and entries are restricted to summary details of chief literary works, the location\
  \ of scholarly individuals (if known) and other relevant particulars. The purpose\
  \ of presenting this list is to aid the general reader and researcher alike in identifying\
  \ individuals who contributed to the classical Irish literary tradition from the\
  \ early medieval period to the beginning of the twentieth century. The compilation\
  \ of lists of Irish poets and scholars has a long pedigree and can be traced to\
  \ medieval author-lists. While much labour has been expended on past endeavours\
  \ to produce a comprehensive listing of the literati of Ireland, what is attempted\
  \ here is a more limited endeavour. The scope of this list is confined to the literati\
  \ of Thomond and whose literary work\u2014or whose role as manuscript custodians,\
  \ scribes or amanuenses\u2014contributed to, or in some way helped forward, the\
  \ classical Irish literary tradition. This list stands as a modern contribution\
  \ to the venerable tradition of listing the Irish literati and their works."
