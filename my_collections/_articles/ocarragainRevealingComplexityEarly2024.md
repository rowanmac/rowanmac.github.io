abstractNote: "CARVED STONE MONUMENTS CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF INFORMATION about\
  \ early ecclesiastical networks, but only if the complexity of these networks is\
  \ appreciated. These were intricate, overlapping and fluid entities, characterised\
  \ not only by outright ownership but by different degrees of tenure and obligation,\
  \ and an array of other less onerous but still meaningful relationships. Using Clonmacnoise-style\
  \ cross-slabs as a case study, we show that even very simple and ostensibly uniform\
  \ monuments can illuminate this complexity through systematic mapping, close scrutiny\
  \ of subtle variations, and by interweaving multiple lines of evidence, both material\
  \ and textual. Using the Digital Atlas of Early Irish Carved Stone (DAEICS), we\
  \ present the first comprehensive analysis of the two cross-forms most closely associated\
  \ with the site. The distribution of Type A slabs is interpreted as a material expression\
  \ of Clonmacnoise\u2019s pre-eminence in Connacht during the \u2018long 8th century\u2019\
  . Within Clonmacnoise\u2019s hinterland, Type B slabs (c ad 800\u20131100) are often\
  \ on documented outlying estates, while some of the others may indicate additional\
  \ landholdings. A minority are further afield, sometimes providing evidence that\
  \ Clonmacnoise-trained carvers travelled 60 kilometres or more. Usually there is\
  \ just one example per outlying site, and unlike their Clonmacnoise counterparts,\
  \ they often lack an inscription. We suggest that, rather than standard grave-markers,\
  \ they were monuments that allowed all those buried there to benefit at a remove\
  \ from the special qualities of the cemetery at Clonmacnoise. Both these distant\
  \ Type B slabs, and related monuments employing the same cross-form, tend to be\
  \ found at sites that sought to associate themselves with Clonmacnoise but are notably\
  \ absent from sites that claimed to be of equal or greater importance. Compared\
  \ to the latter, and indeed within the wider Insular context, Clonmacnoise emerges\
  \ as an outstanding example of how stone-carving could be used to shape relationships\
  \ with subsidiaries and affiliates."
