abstract: "The following communication sets a previously unrecorded manuscript by\
  \ John Locke in context. The manuscript comprises his remarks on a bill to create\
  \ a \u2018Flax and Hemp Company of Ireland\u2019, laid before the Irish House of\
  \ Commons in November 1695, which circulated in London in late 1697. Locke likely\
  \ made his remarks for the lord chancellor, Sir John Somers, among whose papers\
  \ they survive. The manuscript sheds new light on Locke\u2019s practical involvement\
  \ in post-revolutionary political economy, on his engagement with Ireland, and on\
  \ his thought regarding corporations and corporate corruption."
