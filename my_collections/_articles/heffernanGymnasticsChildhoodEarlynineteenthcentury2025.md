abstract: "Beginning in the late 1820s, gymnastics for adults and children became\
  \ a noted phenomenon within some Irish cities. Predominantly led by foreign gymnastic\
  \ instructors, the gymnastics wave marked a specific movement of transnationalism\
  \ within Irish health and education. This article considers Dublin-based gymnastic\
  \ instructors and physicians, weaving together histories of medicine, gender and\
  \ transnationalism. Irish children\u2019s bodies became a site of intense focus\
  \ in the early nineteenth century, and medical and health tracts concerning children\u2019\
  s gymnastics reveal broader fears around the impact of modernity, the deficiencies\
  \ of education and the socialisation of young people. Increasingly, children\u2019\
  s exercise became viewed as being of utmost importance to both the development of\
  \ the individual and, more importantly, to the vitality of the nation itself. This\
  \ contributes significantly to the historiography of Irish childhood by focusing\
  \ not just on discourses, but on the bodies they sought to mould."
