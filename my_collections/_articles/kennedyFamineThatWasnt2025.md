abstract: "The year 1800 is best known in Irish and British history for the passage\
  \ of the Act of Union, a constitutional change that bound Ireland and Britain together\
  \ under the one parliament. Yet the common people had more urgent matters on their\
  \ mind. \u2018Mobs\u2019 took to the streets of Dublin, not to protest at the abolition\
  \ of the Irish parliament in College Green but to protest the hunger that afflicted\
  \ their stomachs. Similar protests took place in other places, from Clonakilty in\
  \ west Cork, Killaloe on the Shannon to Drogheda on the east coast. The years 1799\
  \ and 1800 witnessed poor harvests, with soaring food prices and widespread distress\
  \ in 1800 and 1801 in both Ireland and Britain. The rise in potato prices relative\
  \ to its pre-crisis level was as great in 1799\u20131801 as in the worst years of\
  \ the Great Famine a half century later. Indeed the prices of potatoes and oatmeal,\
  \ the principal means of subsistence for the poorer classes in Ireland, rose more\
  \ in 1799-1801 than at any time between the mid-eighteenth century and the First\
  \ World War. Yet the surprising fact is that Irish society somehow side-stepped\
  \ a full-blown famine. How and why this happened are the subject of this paper."
