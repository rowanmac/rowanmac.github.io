abstract: "The era of the Troubles in Belfast brought both challenges to free movement\
  \ and grassroots responses to such challenges. The conflict itself inspired divisions\
  \ and barriers to mobility within the city, notably including the establishment\
  \ of British Army checkpoints and the construction of various \u201Cpeace walls\u201D\
  \ under the direction of the British Government. While the geospatial significance\
  \ of the Troubles remains a popular and necessary subject of discourse within scholarship\
  \ on the conflict, less attention has been given to considering its relative impact\
  \ on people's daily lives. Interrogating the question of impartiality in conflict-related\
  \ polices, such as the Falls Road Curfew and internment, helps contextualize disproportionate\
  \ disruptions to mobility in the city. Additionally, conflict-related violence frequently\
  \ impacted access to transportation, contributing to community-based initiatives\
  \ to improve movement throughout the city, notably the introduction of black taxi\
  \ services in the 1970s. By focusing on Belfast during the Troubles, this article\
  \ considers the relationships among free movement, conflict, governments, and community-based\
  \ responses to such challenges."
