abstract: "What makes a historical event and, more particularly, what makes\nit memorable?\
  \ Addressing this question in a Victorian context, a\ntime of obsessive preoccupation\
  \ with memorialization and\ncommemoration, the essay considers the case of the Great\
  \ Irish\nFamine, with comparative reference to other contemporary notable\nevents.\
  \ It argues that scale alone\u2014even when it impacts the lives\nof millions of\
  \ people\u2014is not sufficient for attaining prominent\nhistorical recognition\
  \ and that the conditions for major\noccurrences to be remembered in public may\
  \ depend on narratability\n(with reference to how they can be related to familiar\
  \ narratives\nof previous events), mediation (through journalism and literature),\n\
  and politicization."
