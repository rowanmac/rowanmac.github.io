abstract: "Recent scholarship has revealed the extent of eighteenth- century debates\
  \ about the salience of honor in a rapidly modernizing Britain. However, Maria Edgeworth\u2019\
  s contributions to these debates have not been recognized, perhaps because of the\
  \ uneven and disputed modernization of her adopted home, Ireland, with its three\
  \ competing eighteenth- century \u201Chonor worlds.\u201D Ireland\u2019s shifting\
  \ and contested eighteenth-century honor discourses shape and misshape the text\
  \ of Edgeworth\u2019s Castle Rackrent and its authorship, narration, reception,\
  \ and paratext. Initially resolved by inculcating the emergent Irish Catholic middle\
  \ class with modern honor principles through the narrative actions of a novel bardic\
  \ poet narrator, Thady Quirk, the text ultimately undercuts its own resolution of\
  \ the problem of modern Irish honor. Instead, because of her own potential loss\
  \ of honor, effected by the 1801 Union with Great Britain, Edgeworth subverts the\
  \ bardic work of her character-narrator in her novel\u2019s paratext. Ironically,\
  \ Edgeworth\u2019s honor and that of her family would be restored by the favorable\
  \ reception of the very text that attempted to resolve the issue of the modern salience\
  \ of honor in Ireland and then rejected its own resolution."
