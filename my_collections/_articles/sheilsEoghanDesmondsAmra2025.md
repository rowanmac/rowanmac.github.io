abstract: "Irish composer Eoghan Desmond\u2019s cantata Amra Choluim Chille (2019)\
  \ sets the blind poet Dall\xE1n Forgaill\u2019s eulogy in praise of St Columba,\
  \ which is thought to have been written after the death of the saint in ce 597.\
  \ Premiered by Chamber Choir Ireland in March 2023, the work for choir, strings,\
  \ harp and percussion makes a significant contribution to Irish-language choral\
  \ repertoire and represents the only complete choral-orchestral setting of this\
  \ text. Although the piece is solely in the Irish language and contains elements\
  \ of traditional musical idioms, the music is not bound to the traditional style,\
  \ instead drawing on historical and contemporary musical influences to bring Columba\u2019\
  s story to a modern audience. Desmond\u2019s melodic motifs, textural and modal\
  \ structures, and symbolic devices suggest a deep understanding of Dall\xE1n\u2019\
  s text, and the purposeful synthesis of ancient and contemporary musical styles.\
  \ This article explores the key compositional techniques that bring the ancient\
  \ poem to life, focusing on Desmond\u2019s significant use of the St Columba hymn\
  \ tune, traditional musical features and symbolism, as well as his combination of\
  \ historical and contemporary musical processes, to convey the sacred narrative\
  \ in a compelling musical manner."
