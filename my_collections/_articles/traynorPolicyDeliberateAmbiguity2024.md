abstractNote: "Immediately following the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty on 6 December\
  \ 1921, the emergent pro-Treaty regime pursued a strategy to win the brittle loyalty\
  \ of the IRA\u2019s Northern Divisions. The Provisional Government publicly adopted\
  \ a northern policy of deliberate ambiguity which allowed it to appeal to militarists\
  \ and moderates alike. The precariously situated Northern IRA largely accepted the\
  \ Treaty due to these clandestine appeals and promises of military aid. Aware that\
  \ it must maintain an uneasy coalition of diverse constituencies, the Provisional\
  \ Government\u2019s policy evolved from one aligned with militarists to one aimed\
  \ at non-violent co-existence with Northern Ireland."
