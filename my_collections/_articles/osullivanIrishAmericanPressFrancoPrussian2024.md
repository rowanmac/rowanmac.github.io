abstract: "This article explores the Irish-American press\u2019s engagement with the\
  \ Franco-Prussian War, the unification of Germany and the Paris Commune. The leading\
  \ papers \u2014 the Irish-American, the Irish Citizen, The Pilot and the Irish World\
  \ \u2014 commented extensively on the Franco-Prussian War and its aftermath, and\
  \ made use of widespread Irish-American sympathy for France in an attempt to influence\
  \ the evolution of Irish-American ethnic immigrant identity after the American Civil\
  \ War. The article assesses Irish-American editors\u2019 opinions on the French\
  \ and Prussian causes, and explores the parallels drawn with the Irish national\
  \ cause. It then considers the Irish-American press's coverage of the American Republican\
  \ party's pro-German stance after September 1870, which the editors assessed against\
  \ the context of Reconstruction after 1865 and the attempts by Radical Republicans\
  \ to achieve multi-racial citizenship in the United States. Finally, it explores\
  \ Irish-American commentaries on the Paris Commune and the divisions between the\
  \ editors that this international phenomenon fostered. It contributes to the study\
  \ of the Irish-American experience of Reconstruction and the history of American\
  \ engagement with international conflict after 1865."
