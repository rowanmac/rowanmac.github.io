abstract: 'The general public, both within Ireland and further abroad, has begun to
  take an interest in Irish lifting stones. A simple premise, lifting stones are historically
  significant stones which were typically lifted as tests of manhood within rural
  and fishing communities in Ireland. It is an Irish practice with global parallels
  in Europe and Asia. The popular history of this endeavour is currently being written
  with claims that this practice, once popular, was wiped out during the Great Famine.
  This article marks the first academic study of lifting stones in Ireland. It situates
  them in a domestic and global context, discusses the sources one can use in studying
  the topic and uses a combination of folklore, anthropology and fiction to evaluate
  known written sources on the topic. More importantly it highlights the multifaceted
  and gendered histories which can be told through this topic. The article thus seeks
  to do three things: first to raise awareness of the public histories being written
  on this topic, second to implore a more rigid groundwork for studying this practice
  and third to stress the value such an area has in the growing field of masculinity
  studies in Ireland.'
