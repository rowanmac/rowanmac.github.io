abstract: "From small beginnings running a glazing and house-painting business in\
  \ Mountmellick, later members of the Star family became master-painters and wallpaper\
  \ manufacturers in Dublin between 1820 and 1880. In Mountmellick, they were Anglicans\
  \ with a Quaker clientele; in Dublin, a new generation became Catholics, serving\
  \ a Catholic clientele and specialising in church decoration. Their story highlights\
  \ both possibilities and problems in operating a business in nineteenth-century\
  \ Ireland. It also gives a new angle on aspects of Ireland's \u2018devotional revolution\u2019\
  , the nature of Irish nationalism and limits to Dublin's industrial development.\
  \ Building on both historical and genealogical research, a look at one family business\
  \ suggests how other families and their histories, in similar economic and social\
  \ settings, could be described and analysed."
