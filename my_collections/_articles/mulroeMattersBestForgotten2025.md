abstract: "This article examines the structure and role of the Ulster Special Constabulary\
  \ (USC) in rural Ulster in 1922. It is argued the actions of the USC during this\
  \ period have not received sufficient academic or public attention. The origins\
  \ and organisational structure of the Specials are considered and it is claimed\
  \ that the force\u2019s decentralised make-up made it almost impossible to control.\
  \ In terms of personnel, access to newly released archives gives unique insight\
  \ into the force. Traditional assumptions about the connection between the pre-war\
  \ Ulster Volunteer Force and the USC are questioned. Furthermore, it is found that\
  \ few \u2018B\u2019 Specials had prior service with the British army. Overall, it\
  \ is concluded that the Specials were an almost exclusively Protestant force made\
  \ up of inexperienced and at times ill-disciplined recruits, most of whom were ill-suited\
  \ to any policing role. Furthermore, it is argued that the Specials played a significant\
  \ role in shaping post-partition identities in Northern Ireland."
