abstract: "One of the most important formative influences on Bram Stoker was Edward\
  \ Dowden, who as a young don had befriended and impressed the barely younger man,\
  \ introducing him to the work of Walt Whitman. While Catherine Wynne and Adam Putz\
  \ have recently observed the relation between Dowden\u2019s criticism of the Victorian\
  \ stage, and the Irish don\u2019s relation with Irving, few have observed how Stoker\u2019\
  s own fiction is suffused with Dowden\u2019s somewhat sectarian ideas in relation\
  \ to literature and art, as well as his more progressive views on gender. In this\
  \ article, there will be a discussion of the role played by Stoker in promoting\
  \ Dowden\u2019s fame abroad, the ways in which Dowden\u2019s work on Shakespeare\
  \ contributed to the framing of both Renaissance culture and gender relations in\
  \ Stoker\u2019s novel The Mystery of the Sea (1902), and how Dowden\u2019s own appreciation\
  \ of Stoker\u2019s later novel The Man (1905) aids the modern reader in navigating\
  \ that work\u2019s main ideas. Therefore, while Dowden benefited greatly from the\
  \ networking of his quondam student and friend, the intellectual influence of the\
  \ Irish don on the author of Dracula was also seminal to Stoker\u2019s worldview,\
  \ as presented in his later novels."
