abstractNote: "The partition of Ireland in 1921 drew heavily on the census data of\
  \ 1911 to determine how the boundary between North and South was to be demarcated.\
  \ The intention was to ensure a numerical advantage for the Protestant population\
  \ in the new Northern Ireland, sufficient to ensure a permanent unionist majority.\
  \ The publication of the data from the 2021 census in Northern Ireland and the 2022\
  \ census in Ireland allows for an assessment of how the demography has changed over\
  \ the past 100 years, and the extent to which the changed ratio of Catholics and\
  \ Protestants calls into question the longer-term viability of Northern Ireland\
  \ as a polity. The article goes beyond the Catholic\u2013Protestant binary to look\
  \ at the growth in numbers of those with other faiths and those with no religion,\
  \ and the impact of secularisation on the island of Ireland."
