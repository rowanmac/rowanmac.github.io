abstract: "This article seeks both to reassess the dynamics of the Northern Irish\
  \ civil rights movement during the mid to late 1960s, as well as to suggest a new\
  \ understanding of the role of parliamentary forces in furthering the goals of social\
  \ movements. During the 1960s, Northern Ireland underwent significant socio-political\
  \ upheaval, centred on the rights of the region\u2019s Catholic minority and their\
  \ long-term concerns regarding democratic representation, unemployment and housing.\
  \ The resulting civil rights movement sought to avoid the traditional ethno-nationalist\
  \ fault lines of Ulster politics and appealed directly to the British government\
  \ and people, bypassing the devolved Stormont parliament with its permanent Protestant-Unionist\
  \ majority. While vital work has been done to analyse this important period, aspects\
  \ of British-based activism for civil rights in Northern Ireland have not yet been\
  \ fully scrutinised. One key British group was the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster\
  \ (CDU). Primarily made up of backbench Labour MPs, the CDU pursued civil rights\
  \ at Westminster by advocating for governmental inquiries and legislative reform\
  \ to address Catholic grievances. Although highly energetic, the CDU faced deep\
  \ constitutional barriers and the organisation\u2019s efforts have generally been\
  \ seen as unsuccessful. However, new archival work and a reappraisal of previous\
  \ studies suggests a more nuanced view. The CDU had more influence than the organisation\
  \ itself believed. This has implications not only for our understanding of the civil\
  \ rights movement, but also for interpreting the actions of groups such as the CDU,\
  \ described here as \u2018Parliamentary Activists\u2019, both historically and in\
  \ the present day."
