abstract: "Between 1883 and 1897, the British Department of Science and Art\u2019\
  s lace expert Alan S. Cole (1846\u20131934) made eleven official visits to Ireland\
  \ to lecture, inspect lacemaking and design centers, and report on his findings.\
  \ His interventions contributed to a period of growth and development in the industry,\
  \ which had been introduced as a philanthropic venture in the mid-nineteenth century.\
  \ However, Cole\u2019s widely circulated writings on lace design and making produced\
  \ between 1884 and 1897 also reveal ambivalence and inconsistency, particularly\
  \ in relation to questions of mechanization in the lace industry, the agency of\
  \ lacemakers, the relationship between good design and the demands of the market,\
  \ and the home as a locus for lace production. This essay outlines Cole\u2019s involvement\
  \ in the Irish lace industry, placing his reports in the context of contemporary\
  \ design education strategies and texts on lacemaking, and considering how he frames\
  \ the industry\u2014in particular, lacemakers and the spaces of lacemaking\u2014\
  in ways that negotiate the often conflicting needs of the market, design education\
  \ bodies, and philanthropists, and intersect with colonial, gender, and class-based\
  \ imperatives to mold, monitor, and represent Irish women and their homes."
