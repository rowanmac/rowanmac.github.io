abstract: "When Theobald Wolfe Tone arrived in France in February 1796, intent on\
  \ securing French help to win Irish independence from England and to establish a\
  \ republic in Ireland, his greatest challenge was not to convince the Directory\
  \ to launch an expedition to Ireland, but in persuading them that the Irish were\
  \ mature enough to become republicans and were not mere Chouans. Was Tone deluded\
  \ and did he embellish the revolutionary potential of the Irish, especially the\
  \ secret society of the Defenders, as the dominant (revisionist) historiography\
  \ claims? A close look at the available sources, and a new reading against the grain,\
  \ or under a \u2018satanic light\u2019, of the available sources, allows us to better\
  \ delineate what could have been an Irish republic or, at least, to situate the\
  \ Defenders within an Atlantic context of popular politicisation \u2013 the \u2018\
  Atlantic Republic\u2019."
