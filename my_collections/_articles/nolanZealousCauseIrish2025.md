abstract: "This article examines Irish women who acted as agents for the exiled Stuarts\
  \ between 1689 and 1724, focusing in particular on the question of women\u2019s\
  \ political allegiance and their motivation to take deliberate political action.\
  \ It argues that the categorization of \u2018women\u2019 as a collective is inhibitive,\
  \ as it fails to account for a plurality of circumstance and experience, including\
  \ social status, economic status, \u2018nationality\u2019, and/or ethnicity, time\
  \ period, and geographical location. It also recognizes that, for similar reasons,\
  \ the application of collective identity is inhibitive in exploring the history\
  \ of Jacobites and Jacobitism. By focusing on individual acts of identification,\
  \ as opposed to a singular political identity, it is possible to understand loyalty\
  \ to the Stuarts as existing on a spectrum, with the few who committed acts of treason\
  \ on the upper end of that spectrum and the many who could be described as less\
  \ active on the lower end. In taking this view, it is possible to identify links\
  \ between active and less active Jacobites, and to recognize opportunities for movement\
  \ from relative inactivity to instances or periods of activity, particularly in\
  \ response to episodes of war or rebellion. The significance of gender in the context\
  \ of a subversive and often treasonous movement is explored throughout. The case\
  \ of Catherine Lucas is used to interrogate the importance of gender and existing\
  \ social infrastructure in facilitating the treasonous activities of women agents\
  \ and in providing such women with a measure of protection."
