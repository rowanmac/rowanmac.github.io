abstract: "This article explores the Royal Irish Constabulary Commemoration controversy\
  \ of 2020. It argues that the Irish government\u2019s attempts to separate the \u2018\
  good\u2019 (Irish) recruits from \u2018bad\u2019 (British) recruits to the force\
  \ can be linked to longer-running trends in Irish collective memory, and is an example\
  \ of what has been termed \u2018commemorative memory\u2019: where historical narratives\
  \ are used (instrumentally) \u2018to legitimise collective identities and social\
  \ institutions\u2019. The RIC commemoration, it is argued, bore resemblances to\
  \ the revisionist controversy of the 1980s, which saw debates about the morality\
  \ of violence where the (legitimate) campaign of the \u2018old IRA\u2019 was contrasted\
  \ with the (illegitimate) campaign of the Provisional IRA. The result, it contends,\
  \ was that the government\u2019s attempt at an inclusive commemoration in a \u2018\
  post-imperial\u2019 setting inadvertently pathologised those of British heritage\
  \ in Ireland."
