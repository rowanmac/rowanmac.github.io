abstract: "This article demonstrates that, notwithstanding Ireland's 1949 Commonwealth\
  \ secession, it (re)established an informal external association with this grouping's\
  \ principal concrete concerns, which remained quite extensive, that lasted throughout\
  \ the 1950s. By law or practice, 1950s Ireland lifted alien restrictions on most\
  \ Commonwealth citizens and its citizens received preferential treatment in most\
  \ Commonwealth countries. It participated in the Commonwealth tariff \u2018system'\
  \ by both giving and receiving preferences based on \u2018Commonwealth' status and\
  \ by maintaining long-standing trade agreements with the UK, Canada and South Africa.\
  \ As with all the Commonwealth bar Canada, it remained within the Sterling Area\
  \ which greatly bolstered economic links. Ireland also participated in several lower-level\
  \ Commonwealth fora and its \u2018special position' was said to strikingly illustrate\
  \ the Commonwealth's capacity to adjust. However, it took no part in high-level\
  \ political consultation and, even in functional areas (with the singular exception\
  \ of agricultural research), lacked privileges to exercise leadership or even clear\
  \ rights. These limitations bolstered interest in rejoining especially in the late\
  \ 1950s. However, allied to a background a recognition that the Commonwealth was\
  \ becoming less central to concrete links including in the crucial UK context, this\
  \ was rendered politically impossible by the unresolved issue of Partition."
