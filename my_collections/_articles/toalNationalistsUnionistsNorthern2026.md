abstract: "The article charts the changing fortunes of the Catholics of Lisburn, County\
  \ Antrim from 1914\u201322. It begins by exploring the establishment of a local\
  \ battalion of the Irish National Volunteers and analysing Catholic recruitment\
  \ to the war effort, before turning to the Easter Rising (1916), its aftermath and\
  \ the bitter sectarian riots of August 1920, following the assassination of RIC\
  \ District Inspector Swanzy. This murder in the centre of Lisburn led to days of\
  \ violence and forced many of the town\u2019s Catholics to flee. This paper argues\
  \ that relations between nationalists and unionists in the 1914\u201322 period should\
  \ be understood in the context of unionist beliefs regarding their communal safety\
  \ and that territorial security is key to understanding the presence and form of\
  \ violence in the town during the Swanzy Riots. Finally, some consideration is given\
  \ to how this case study of Lisburn offers insight into understanding communal violence\
  \ elsewhere in Ireland, during the wartime and revolutionary period."
