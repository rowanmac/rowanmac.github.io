abstract: "This article considers the encounter between Irish and Indian advanced\
  \ nationalists through the prism of a group of university students who came from\
  \ India to Ireland to study law between 1913 and 1916. Before considering their\
  \ interaction with Irish politics and the inspiration they drew from it, it explores\
  \ the possible push and pull factors that may have drawn nationally minded Indian\
  \ law students to come to Ireland in the years before 1913. It establishes for the\
  \ first time the administrative and political reasons why Dublin became an attractive\
  \ city for some Indians who wished to study law in Ireland rather than England.\
  \ Exploring the life of Indian law students in Dublin in the years before the Easter\
  \ Rising of 1916, the article focuses on V. V. Giri, at the time just one of the\
  \ small groups of Dublin\u2019s Indian law students studying between the King\u2019\
  s Inns and University College Dublin. Giri later became the fourth president of\
  \ India, but his prominence here is that he left a memoir of his time in Ireland.\
  \ The memoir allows for an exploration of a history that is otherwise largely forgotten\
  \ and of which only the slightest traces remain in Irish and British archival sources,\
  \ making this as much a study of the process of historical reconstruction as it\
  \ is of its subjects."
