abstract: When the Irish foreign service was formed in 1919, the Department of Foreign
  Affairs in Dublin lacked systematic policies for record-keeping. Based on a thorough
  understanding of the primary and secondary sources, this research focuses on the
  people, records management and material resources at work before the appointment
  of an official archivist in 1936. This article deals with the relevance of lawyers
  and journalists to the staff in Dublin, communication patterns, the employment of
  women, limited resources, legislation for records, and the influence of librarians
  during the period.
