abstract: "This essay aims to examine the most characteristic aspect of the nineteenth-century\
  \ Anglophone theatre, its dominance by the adaptation of French plays. It lays out\
  \ some of the underlying theatrical conditions in both Paris and London, and examines\
  \ the British discourse about adaptation, which covered a spectrum from condemnation\
  \ to roguish delight. Using two case studies, John Buckstone\u2019s The Irish Lion\
  \ and Dion Boucicault\u2019s The Corsican Brothers, the essay argues that \u201C\
  adaptation from the French\u201D was not a singular or consistent process. It could\
  \ range instead from the appropriation of a single idea to something close to direct\
  \ translation. More than this, the essay suggests that attention to adaptive processes\
  \ can illuminate national difference, cultural equivalence, and aspects of theatre\
  \ history. Thus it becomes clear that the Irish Lion transforms a spoof on the Parisian\
  \ celebrity of Jean-Jacques Rousseau into a joke about the London lionization of\
  \ the Irish poet Thomas Moore. Meanwhile, close examination of The Corsican Brothers\
  \ reveals that the most famous ghostly effects of Charles Kean\u2019s 1852 staging\
  \ were not solely attributable to Boucicault, or to Kean. Instead, they responded\
  \ to the dramaturgy of Eug\xE8ne Grang\xE9 and Xavier de Mont\xE9pin, who adapted\
  \ the novel by Alexandre Dumas p\xE8re for the Parisian Th\xE9\xE2tre Historique.\
  \ In this case, the most critical work was not translation, but transmediation.\
  \ At the same time, adaptation was necessarily responsive to local expectations.\
  \ The Corsican Brothers reflected cultural shifts occasioned by the Theatres Act\
  \ of 1843, and fed a new British appetite for \u201Cgentlemanly melodrama.\u201D\
  \ Above all, the dominance of \u201Cadaptation from the French\u201D relied on personal\
  \ links and cultural parallels which tied London to Paris, not least in the reputational\
  \ likeness observable between Boucicault and Dumas."
