abstract: "Luxury items bought in nineteenth-century London\u2019s fashionable West\
  \ End, and the time spent browsing there, were examples of conspicuous consumption.\
  \ This article uses a case-study of 200 bills to explore the shopping preferences\
  \ of Mary Anne St Leger, Viscountess Doneraile, a member of the Irish peerage who\
  \ lived during the years of the class\u2019 most dramatic decline. Building on consumption\
  \ studies, I argue that Doneraile\u2019s shopping practices, and her preference\
  \ for London over Irish suppliers, were an exercise in \u2018quiet luxury\u2019\
  \ as she used her cultural capital to make discerning choices. She curated her membership\
  \ of Britain\u2019s social elite through London-bought goods."
