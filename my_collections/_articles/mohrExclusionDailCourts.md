abstract: "This article compares the attitude of the Irish government in power in\
  \ the early 1920s towards two differing judicial institutions that were omitted\
  \ from the Courts of Justice Act 1924. This pioneering legislation created the system\
  \ of courts that largely persists in the modern Irish State. The first object of\
  \ comparison concerns the attitude of the Irish government of this period towards\
  \ the \u2018D\xE1il courts\u2019 that had been created by Irish nationalist authorities\
  \ in 1920 in opposition to the official courts of the United Kingdom in Ireland.\
  \ The second concerns governmental attitudes towards the appeal from the Irish courts\
  \ to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the final appellate court for\
  \ most of the British Commonwealth and Empire. This article argues that the sidelining\
  \ of these differing institutions by this important legislation has more shared\
  \ features than is immediately apparent. Both institutions were influenced by the\
  \ 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State. The Irish government accused both judicial\
  \ institutions of incompetence and bias in interpreting Irish law. Their common\
  \ marginalization by the Courts of Justice Act 1924 also reflects dual political\
  \ challenges facing the Irish government in the early 1920s."
