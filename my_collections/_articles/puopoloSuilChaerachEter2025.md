abstract: ", abstract:, The ninth-century Longes mac nUislenn (LMU), the \u2018Exile\
  \ of the sons of Uisliu\u2019, the oldest surviving version of the popular \u2018\
  Deirdriu story\u2019, presents a stri-dent female protagonist who may at first glance\
  \ appear to be proto-feminist. However, its political lessons ultimately reveal\
  \ a conservative, patriarchal political order driven by male homosociality and undermined\
  \ by female agency. The present article examines desire and its political consequences\
  \ in LMU. Specifically, this article leverages theoretical tools from Louise Aranye\
  \ Fradenburg\u2019s work on desire and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick\u2019s work on homosociality\
  \ to analyze moments of decision-making in the text (where desire is most palpable)\
  \ and map the constellation of desirous connections that revolve around the tale\u2019\
  s protagonist, Deirdriu. Doing so reveals how the tale predicates Conchobor\u2019\
  s kingship upon the successful conversion of desire into power, despite his unsavory\
  \ behavior. Conversely, the inability of Deirdriu and the sons of Uisliu to do the\
  \ same seals their tragic fate."
