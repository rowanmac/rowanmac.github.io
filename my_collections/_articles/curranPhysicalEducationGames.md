abstract: "This article examines the implementation of physical education in Ireland\u2019\
  s reformatory and industrial schools, which were established in the latter half\
  \ of the nineteenth century. It will focus on the years from 1858 until shortly\
  \ after the partition of Ireland in 1921, while acknowledging the general bias towards\
  \ the role of authorities in official reports. It will identify the systems of physical\
  \ education utilised in these schools and will offer a comparison with primary and\
  \ intermediate schools in the pre-partition years. It will show that external and\
  \ internal drill instructors were utilised and that pupils participated in physical\
  \ displays to highlight the progress made and to encourage discipline. Some also\
  \ took part in competitions held before dignitaries and patrons, and at times made\
  \ use of local facilities. In this way, the reformatory and industrial school education\
  \ systems were not unlike more mainstream schools in those years, but facilities\
  \ were often limited and lacked the development of those in more affluent intermediate\
  \ schools."
