abstract: "This article is drawn from a broader research project exploring Irish wakes,\
  \ funerals, and the specialists who make these rites of passage possible. My thanks\
  \ go first to the many undertakers, embalmers, gravediggers, coffin makers, monument\
  \ carvers, crematorium operators, clergy, and civil and humanist celebrants across\
  \ Ireland who have taken the time to speak with me and let me observe them in action.\
  \ This article would not have been possible without the perspectives and patience\
  \ of Colin Mc Ateer, Martin Boyle, Harry McGrenaghan, and Tiernan Roulston. I offer\
  \ special thanks to them and also to Reverend Jo Mc Ateer, Olivia Owens, Jason Baird\
  \ Jackson, Emily Bianchi, Fionn\xE1n Mac Gabhann, and Ryan Lash for multiple insights\
  \ and forms of assistance. Except where noted, the photos are by the author."
