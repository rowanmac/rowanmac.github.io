abstract: "In the decade before the Great Famine, Ireland experienced a boom in microfinance\
  \ institutions (MFIs). Taking a social enterprise perspective, this paper analyses\
  \ the institutional context for this boom. It finds \xADevidence linking the boom\
  \ in MFIs to the development, via the introduction of the poor law in 1838, of a\
  \ nascent welfare state at the end of a very turbulent period in Irish history.\
  \ Many contemporary writers saw microfinance as a legal means that could lessen\
  \ the burden on rate payers by helping the poor help themselves. Econometric analysis\
  \ at Poor Law Union level confirms the link between MFIs, an Irish solution, and\
  \ the poor law, a British solution, to Ireland\u2019s chronic poverty. The goal\
  \ of the Irish solution was to address what was perceived to be the cause of poverty,\
  \ a want of capital, while the British solution addressed the symptoms of poverty\
  \ but not its root cause."
