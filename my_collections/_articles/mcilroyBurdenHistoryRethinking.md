abstract: "Scholarly attention within the field of documentary cinema in the last\
  \ twenty years or so has developed a new branch of studies often focused on what\
  \ is termed the essay film. This mode of expression commonly associated with post-war\
  \ filmmakers such as Alain Resnais and Chris Marker frequently seeks an appropriate\
  \ mode of address to come to terms with a traumatic past. This essay endeavours\
  \ to bring some of the insights of critics on the essay film, such as Nora Alter,\
  \ Timothy Corrigan, Philip Lopate, and Laura Rascaroli to an Irish context. In particular,\
  \ the essay films by Peter Lennon and Mark Cousins are discussed as best seen and\
  \ understood within this new context. It is argued that these films seek to unburden\
  \ the suffocating effects of Irish history and serve as a kind of medication for\
  \ past and ongoing injuries. An effort is also made to build an admittedly imperfect\
  \ genealogy of the Irish essay film by reaching back to the 1940s and referring\
  \ briefly to the work of Liam O\u2019Laoghaire and subsequently George Morrison\
  \ in the early 1960s."
