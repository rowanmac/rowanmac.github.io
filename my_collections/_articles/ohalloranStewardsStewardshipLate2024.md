abstract: "In the court of a late medieval Gaelic Irish lord, the steward (maor, pl.\
  \ maoir) was a fiscal officer tasked with gathering tribute in the form of foodstuffs,\
  \ rent, or tax. Maoir in this period are shadowy administrative figures, the archetype\
  \ of which is a paid professional of relatively low social status. A geographically\
  \ broad assessment seeks to show that the office of maor was fundamental to the\
  \ tribute gathering apparatus that underpinned the administration of a Gaelic Irish\
  \ lordship. A detailed examination of the O'Rodan (U\xED Rod\xE1in) lineage in Thomond\
  \ sheds light on the functions of maoir in practice. From the mid-fourteenth century,\
  \ the O'Rodans became enriched through the provision of stewardship services to\
  \ the McNamara (Meic Conmara) lords of Clann Chuil\xE9in. Their later entry into\
  \ the service of the O'Brien (U\xED Bhriain) earls of Thomond provides insight into\
  \ the ability of maoir to shift allegiance."
