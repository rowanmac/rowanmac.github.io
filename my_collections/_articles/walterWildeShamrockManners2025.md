abstract: "Historians continue to debate what form colonial rule took in early modern\
  \ Ireland. This article explores how the reception and resistance to anglicisation,\
  \ located in the everyday body language of submission and subordination encoded\
  \ in gesture, might be understood in the experience of colonial rule. Exploring\
  \ the gestural code operating in early modern Ireland, this article examines the\
  \ role of body politics in the reception of and reaction to English rule. English\
  \ \u2018manners and apparel\u2019 were central to the project of anglicisation.\
  \ The body played a central role in representing and articulating social hierarchies\
  \ in the early modern world. Body language offered a troubling everyday reminder\
  \ of the inequalities signalled in the \u2014 non-reciprocal or non-reciprocated\
  \ \u2014 gestures expected of \u2018subordinates\u2019 towards \u2018superiors\u2019\
  . If the enforcement of the gestural order was important to the establishment of\
  \ English rule, this also made gesture a focus for resistance and opposition. A\
  \ body politics that exploited a shared understanding of the meaning of particular\
  \ gestures could be drawn on in both everyday politics and collective protests to\
  \ subvert, resist and retaliate against the political agenda of anglicisation. Looking\
  \ forward to the eighteenth century and beyond state action, the article calls for\
  \ more work on gesture."
