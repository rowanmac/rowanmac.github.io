abstract: "From 1945 and into the 1950s in Ireland's economic history has been described\
  \ as post-war recovery and gloom and doom respectively, leading to the 1960s golden\
  \ age. However, despite this gloomy outlook, with some delays attributed to the\
  \ Emergency, a \u2018quiet revolution\u2019 kicked off in late 1946. That revolution\
  \ was the Rural Electrification Scheme (RES) of the Electricity Supply Board of\
  \ Ireland, a scheme designed to bring electric power to every village in Ireland.\
  \ While some academic research has addressed the RES, detail on specific locations\
  \ and effects is lacking, which is surprising given the effects the scheme had on\
  \ life and economy in rural Ireland. Drawing on archival evidence, existing history\
  \ texts, media and some oral histories, this paper explores the story of the first\
  \ village to receive power under the RES, namely the village of Oldtown in County\
  \ Dublin. This story is largely untold, and in particular, why this village was\
  \ the first is explored. The benefits of electric power to rural homes and farms\
  \ are also detailed. In the case of farming, early shoots of today's thriving tillage\
  \ and horticultural activity typical of North County Dublin are apparent."
