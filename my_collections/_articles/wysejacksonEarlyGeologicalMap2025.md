abstract: "In the second decade of the 1800s Richard John Griffith was preparing a\
  \ geological map of Ireland. This was to finally be published in 1838 on a small\
  \ scale with a larger quarter-inch map appearing in the following year. Recently,\
  \ a water-coloured manuscript geological map of Ireland has been located in the\
  \ George Bellas Greenough collection of the Geological Society of London. It represents\
  \ a collaborative trans-Irish Sea effort between Griffith and Greenough to display\
  \ Ireland\u2019s geological structure, and probably dates from 1814. On a copy of\
  \ Alexander Taylor\u2019s 1793 map of Ireland Greenough provided marginal notes,\
  \ delineated some geological boundaries with particular attention paid to County\
  \ Donegal, and provided the names of nine lithological types in no apparent stratigraphic\
  \ order. He then sent the otherwise blank map to Griffith, who applied the watercolour\
  \ wash to show the distribution of those lithologies, before he returned the map\
  \ to London. This manuscript geological map of Ireland may pre-date that attributed\
  \ to Alexander Nimmo, which dates from no later than 1822."
