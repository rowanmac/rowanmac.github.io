abstract: "The relative success of the Danish and failure of the Irish dairy industries\
  \ before the First World War is often contrasted. The traditional narrative assumes\
  \ that the Irish failed because they were unsuccessful at adopting cooperative ownership,\
  \ and that Irish cooperatives were not as efficient as their Danish counterparts,\
  \ despite having been explicitly modelled on them. This is, however, untested at\
  \ the \u2018firm\u2019 level. We rectify this through the analysis of a large microlevel\
  \ database of creameries in both countries over the period 1898\u20131903. Using\
  \ Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA), a standard methodology in modern productivity\
  \ studies, we find that Irish creameries were in fact slightly more efficient on\
  \ average than their Danish counterparts, although with a larger variance. This\
  \ nuances the idea that the Irish were unable to establish cooperatives successfully,\
  \ although some creameries were certainly laggards, and the reputational cost of\
  \ this might have impacted the industry."
