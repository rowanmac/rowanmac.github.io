abstract: "As part of the seventeenth colonial conflagration, known as \u201CWars\
  \ of the Three Kingdoms,\u201D incidents of sexual violence\u2014stripping, castration,\
  \ mutilation, rape, gang rape, and reproductive violations\u2014occurred against\
  \ women and some men across Ireland. The historical and legal evidence for this\
  \ violence was recorded in witness statements that form part of an archive, known\
  \ as the \u201C1641 Depositions.\u201D This article examines this extraordinary\
  \ archive, now housed in Trinity College Dublin and published online, especially\
  \ the witness testimony provided by Protestant women. It explores how sexual violence\
  \ was reported and then politicized. Though testimony that related to sexual violence\
  \ was rarely used in the courtroom, Protestant propagandists\u2014from the seventeenth\
  \ to the twentieth centuries\u2014manipulated these accounts to instill fear and\
  \ justify retribution."
