abstract: "The historical consensus on Cumann na mBan, Ireland\u2019s republican women\u2019\
  s organisation, suggests that by the period of the Second World War (or Emergency\
  \ as it was known in independent Ireland) it was largely inactive. This article\
  \ explores the organisation\u2019s activity in this period, framing it as part of\
  \ the group's post-revolutionary afterlife. Through consideration of Cumann na mBan's\
  \ records, state records from the Department of Justice and newspaper material this\
  \ article considers the work of Cumann na mBan and other republican women in support\
  \ of prisoners and their dependents. This article also discusses how existing republican\
  \ feminist networks, forged during Ireland's revolution, remained central to this\
  \ prisoner support work throughout the Second World War. It considers how republican\
  \ women had agency and ownership of a significant area of republican activism through\
  \ welfare work. It also discusses how Cumann na mBan's status as an auxiliary to\
  \ the IRA was contentious from its foundation and remained so throughout this period."
