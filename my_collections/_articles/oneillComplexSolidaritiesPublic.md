abstract: "Since 2020, Irish people have donated over $2.5 million to a relief fund\
  \ supporting residents of the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northeastern Arizona.\
  \ Many donors believed their contributions helped `repay a debt' owed by the Irish\
  \ to Native Americans\u2014specifically, the Choctaw Nation, which sent aid to Ireland\
  \ during the 1847 Famine. This article examines how Irish people understand their\
  \ historical links to settler colonialism and how valid or common it is for them\
  \ to express solidarity with other colonized peoples, particularly Indigenous groups.\
  \ Focusing on the relationship between the Irish and Native Americans, especially\
  \ the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma since the 1990s, the article explores this expression\
  \ of solidarity. It considers the historical rationale offered by Irish donors to\
  \ the Navajo and Hopi between 2020 and 2024 via GoFundMe, framing it as repayment\
  \ for the Choctaw's 1847 gift. Using Charles Mills' concept of white ignorance,\
  \ the article critiques how these acts of solidarity can obscure Ireland's own role\
  \ in settler colonialism\u2014from treaty negotiations that displaced Indigenous\
  \ peoples to participation in land dispossession. By selectively remembering shared\
  \ suffering while ignoring complicity in colonialism, Irish narratives reveal a\
  \ more complex and sometimes problematic form of solidarity."
