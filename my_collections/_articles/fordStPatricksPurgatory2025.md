abstract: "Patrick\u2019s purgatory in Lough Derg, Donegal, is one of the great medieval\
  \ pilgrimage sites. On the extreme edge of Europe, it physically embodied the theological\
  \ idea of purgatory, offering pilgrims a this-worldly encounter with its horrors.\
  \ Despite Protestant efforts to destroy it, it survived the Reformation and posed\
  \ a classic challenge for Protestant and Roman Catholic historians. For the latter,\
  \ it exemplified the continuity of Catholicism in Ireland from Patrick to the present,\
  \ a living embodiment of the unchanging loyalty of the Irish people to their national\
  \ saint. For Protestant historians, it was, like purgatory, a twelfth-century invention,\
  \ revealing both the medieval corruption of the Roman Catholic Church as it added\
  \ non-scriptural embellishments to the Christian faith, and the superstition of\
  \ Irish Catholicism. The interaction, and tension, between theological belief and\
  \ historical objectivity was to prove a persistent challenge for both sides, right\
  \ down to the twentieth century."
