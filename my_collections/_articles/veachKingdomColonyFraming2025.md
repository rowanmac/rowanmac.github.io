abstract: "This article offers a new way of framing the English conquest of Ireland\
  \ by focusing on the development of a kingdom of Ireland both before and after the\
  \ invasion of 1169. It thus spans the historiographical divides that tend to partition\
  \ Irish history at the point of the English invasion, and which also frequently\
  \ disaggregate the study of British and Irish history. By exploring the complexity\
  \ of Irish political society and culture before 1169, one can see how King Henry\
  \ II sought to use its structures to facilitate his annexation of \u2018the kingdom\
  \ of Ireland\u2019 in 1171\u20132. This included the Church, which offered Henry\u2019\
  s dynasty the ideological support and legitimacy it had once provided for Gaelic\
  \ kings of Ireland. Paying attention to the numerous references to the \u2018kingdom\
  \ of Ireland\u2019 in the records of the English government also highlights the\
  \ processes by which Henry\u2019s son John and his successors sought to Anglicise\
  \ this kingdom by imposing England\u2019s laws, institutions and political culture\
  \ upon it. Crucially, ultimate control of these structures remained with the administration\
  \ in England, so in this way Ireland was transformed from a kingdom to a colony.\
  \ Recognising this liminal period in the development of Anglo-Ireland provides context\
  \ for the emerging colonial community in Ireland, as well as strategies of resistance\
  \ and compromise employed by the Gaelic Irish under English rule."
