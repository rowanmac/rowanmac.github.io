abstract: "This article explores how McClinton\u2019s Colleen Soap used the figure\
  \ of the colleen to craft Irishness in its marketing through advertisements in the\
  \ British and Irish press (1910\u20131923). Using visual social semiotic analysis,\
  \ it examines the co-deployment of language, image, colour, typography, layout and\
  \ composition to articulate and negotiate representations of Irishness and its evolution\
  \ over time. Ultimately, it reveals the various ways in which Irish identity was\
  \ self-fashioned and presented to both British and Irish audiences, drawing on contemporary\
  \ political issues and the concept of \u201Ccivilised whiteness,\u201D thus demonstrating\
  \ the fluid, fragile and sometimes fictitious nature of national identity. McClinton\u2019\
  s Colleen Soap, therefore, serves as a rich case study for examining how Irishness\
  \ was continuously reinvented, reimagined and remarketed, and how a small Ulster\
  \ company navigated its relationship with the British Empire during a turbulent\
  \ period in its history."
