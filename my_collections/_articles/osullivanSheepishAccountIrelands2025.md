abstract: "This essay addresses the question of why Ireland's sheep and wool diminished\
  \ in economic importance during an era in which they seemed to count so much for\
  \ other states. From 1780 to 1800, the Irish Government and Parliament enjoyed greater\
  \ autonomy to shape what Julian Hoppit describes as a \u2018political economy of\
  \ wool' but used it to discount sheep and wool. After the Union, there was a belated\
  \ effort by Irish political elites to promote sheep and wool in Ireland's improvement,\
  \ but it proved a spectacular failure. Integrating political economy and economic\
  \ history, the essay shows the importance of wool in Ireland\u2019s political dynamics\
  \ and the profound impact of these politics on the economic history of Irish sheep\
  \ and wool."
