abstract: "Most scholars believe that Spenser\u2019s View was written in 1596. This\
  \ study indicates that it is a 1596 amalgamation of two elements: one drafted about\
  \ 1589 when an optimistic Spenser portrayed the controversial actions of Lord Grey\
  \ de Wilton in Ireland as a humanist enterprise; the other composed in 1596 when\
  \ a panic-stricken Spenser, believing England\u2019s control over Ireland to be\
  \ in jeopardy, argued for the appointment of a new governor, backed by a fresh cohort\
  \ of English Protestant officials, who would revive the abandoned policies of Grey.\
  \ Each element of the text proposed actions that may have seemed extreme to educated\
  \ people in England. However, it is shown how the successive denigration by Spenser\u2019\
  s interlocutors of the Gaelic, the Old English and the English Protestant elements\
  \ of Ireland\u2019s population, reflected opinions that were widespread among English\
  \ settlers in Ireland. For them experience was the most reliable source of knowledge."
