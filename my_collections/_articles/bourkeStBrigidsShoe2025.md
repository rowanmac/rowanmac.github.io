abstract: "This paper provides for the first time a description and interpretation\
  \ of the metal shoe commonly referred to as the shrine of St Brigid\u2019s shoe.\
  \ Associated with Loughrea, Co. Galway, the shoe was acquired by George Petrie before\
  \ 1845 and is now held as part of the Royal Irish Academy collection by the National\
  \ Museum of Ireland. Four key findings are presented. First, that the date inscribed\
  \ on the shoe, ostensibly 1410, is in fact 1710 and refers to the year of its manufacture.\
  \ Second, that the shoe is unlikely to have been a reliquary but was a surrogate\
  \ in devotional terms. Third, that the shoe is specifically derivative of a seventeenth-century\
  \ shoe-shaped reliquary preserved at Asti in northern Italy. Fourth, that an inscription\
  \ on the shoe carries a political message in defiance of contemporary legislation.\
  \ The shoe is discussed throughout with reference to the medieval cult of St Brigid\
  \ and to wider Irish tradition."
