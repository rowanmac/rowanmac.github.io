abstract: "This essay puts Irish revolutionary James Connolly into conversation with\
  \ the much more well-known figure of Frantz Fanon. Both thinker-combatants were\
  \ deeply situated in their own contexts, giving rise to political theory and action\
  \ as expressions of the politics of colonized peoples. While David Lloyd has suggested\
  \ that the similarities between these and other \u201Cnational Marxists\u201D are\
  \ tendential, there do exist numerous positive similarities in their work. Both\
  \ Connolly and Fanon were anticolonial theorists committed to a project of disalienation\
  \ beyond mere expropriation of the means of production but encompassing the realm\
  \ of the symbolic. Both were ardent internationalists, presenting a theory of the\
  \ relationship of the universal to the particular which saw national liberation\
  \ as an intrinsic part of the socialist struggle \u2013 and vice versa. And both\
  \ stressed revolutionary transformation as a necessary mode of liberatory praxis,\
  \ up to and including the use of organized violence. While James Connolly and Frantz\
  \ Fanon were never directly linked, they are of a type, and this essay marks a small\
  \ first step towards bringing their work into a larger, productive synthesis."
