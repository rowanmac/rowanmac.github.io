abstract: "This article uses inventory evidence for the possessions of households\
  \ in later fifteenth-century County Dublin, an area largely characterised by rural\
  \ settlement. Because household goods are often only indifferently recorded, its\
  \ focus is less on individual cases than on larger patterns of consumption between\
  \ social groups. In particular, by making comparisons with inventories from later\
  \ medieval England and from the wine-growing Gers region of south-west France in\
  \ the mid fifteenth century, it explores both how far evidence from County Dublin\
  \ fits within and helps suggest wider European \u2018peasant\u2019 and \u2018bourgeois\u2019\
  \ patterns of consumption. By extension it explores the boundaries between the urban\
  \ and the rural and how far a hybrid suburban identity can be discerned. In some\
  \ cases a combination of close reading and statistical analysis is used to recover\
  \ occupational identities, something that the source does not specifically record.\
  \ The significance of the material culture of specific households is examined in\
  \ two instances \u2014 one that of Lady Margaret Nugent, a wealthy and devout widow\
  \ living in Dublin's St Michan's parish, and the other that of a couple who managed\
  \ an inn located next to one of the city gates."
