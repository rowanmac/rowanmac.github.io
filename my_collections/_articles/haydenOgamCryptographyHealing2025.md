abstract: "Ogam is well known as a writing system invented for the Irish language\
  \ and used extensively for inscriptions on stone monuments across Ireland and Britain\
  \ between the late fourth and seventh centuries. Although the script has primarily\
  \ been examined in the context of early medieval archaeology and epigraphy, its\
  \ long afterlife as an integral part of Irish manuscript culture from the medieval\
  \ to modern periods has also been acknowledged. The present contribution seeks to\
  \ add to the existing scholarship on manuscript ogam by discussing the transmission\
  \ of ideas about the script as a cryptic device into the nineteenth century, with\
  \ a particular focus on a recently discovered notebook, National Library of Scotland\
  \ (Edinburgh) Advocates\u2019 Manuscript 50.3.11 (or \u2018The Minchin Manuscript\u2019\
  ), which consists almost entirely of healing charms written in ogam."
