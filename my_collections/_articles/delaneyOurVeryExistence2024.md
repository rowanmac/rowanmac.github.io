abstract: "This article explores the Department of Education's programme of co-operation\
  \ and rationalisation within the Irish post-primary school sector during the period\
  \ 1966\u201370. Through a systematic analysis of government files and private convent\
  \ archival collections, especially those of the Presentation Sisters, combined with\
  \ oral history interviews, this study provides a unique insight into how co-operation\
  \ and rationalisation in the post-primary sector were reconciled at ground level.\
  \ It exposes the previously hidden history of voluntary secondary school authorities\
  \ and the role they played in educational reform during the 1960s and explores how\
  \ individual school authorities received, responded to and reacted to this new government\
  \ initiative. To a large extent, the success of co-operation and rationalisation\
  \ depended on the willingness of school authorities to accept and comply with departmental\
  \ directives. This study, thus, expands understandings of the history of the Irish\
  \ education system in general and of the reform period (c.1957\u201272) in particular."
