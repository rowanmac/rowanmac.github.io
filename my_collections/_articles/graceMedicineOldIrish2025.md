abstract: Old Irish law tracts provide valuable insights into the practice of medicine
  in Ireland during the early medieval period. While the focus of the law texts relating
  to medicine was predominantly medico-legal, with an emphasis on computing compensation
  for injury, an understanding of contemporary medical practice can also be inferred
  from such texts. Male and female practitioners used herbs and surgery to treat their
  patients and supervised nursing care with a particular emphasis on diet. Physicians
  also provided an all-important public prognosis for the patient. The nature of the
  injury, the probable outcome and the status of the victim determined the level of
  compensation to be paid by the guilty party. Practitioners were also sometimes called
  upon to adjudicate in intimate and marital affairs. Synthesising information gleaned
  from the Old Irish law tracts, this article provides a unique insight into medicine
  in early medieval Ireland in terms of the status of physicians, known medical knowledge
  and contemporary practice.
