abstract: "How migrants navigate their sense of home between the place left behind\
  \ and the new place of destination is a crucial question. The social scientific\
  \ perspective has increasingly come to emphasize the multiplicity of home and appreciates\
  \ that home provides a bridge between \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Cthere.\u201D In\
  \ this article we explore how notions of home compare between migrants who arrived\
  \ in the US throughout the 19th and 20th century. We can draw on a uniquely rich\
  \ comparative set of letters written by people who left German-speaking Europe or\
  \ Ireland. Our analysis of more than 12,000 letters uses methods of linguistic analysis\
  \ to navigate between a macro-perspective, focused on term frequencies, a meso-perspective\
  \ focused on the contextual meaning of the terms home and Heimat, and a micro-perspective\
  \ providing in-depth details of two sets of letter collections. We find that the\
  \ emotional words used to express an affective link with home reveal a deeper process\
  \ of socio-cultural integration among the two groups. Indeed, we find that home\
  \ is being talked about a lot more frequently in the Irish compared to the German\
  \ letters, pointing to a profound divergence in the integration process. In the\
  \ German letters, America quickly became home, which occurred at a much slower rate\
  \ among the Irish. Moreover, the Irish maintained a desire to return home to Ireland\
  \ for longer, an idea that the German writers contemplated only rarely."
