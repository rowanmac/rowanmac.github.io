abstract: "On 31 August 1994, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) announced\
  \ a ceasefire. Over the previous two-and-a-half decades, it had waged western Europe\u2019\
  s most lethal and enduring insurgency, claiming the lives of over 1,700 people.\
  \ The IRA\u2019s \u2018armed struggle\u2019 had been a key driver of \u2018the Troubles\u2019\
  \ that beset Northern Ireland; its decision to end the campaign of violence was\
  \ likewise integral to an emergent peace process. Almost from the moment it was\
  \ declared, commentators and historians have debated the IRA ceasefire. Why did\
  \ it happen? What did it mean? Which side had blinked first in the long war between\
  \ the British government and the IRA? In seeking to answer such questions, an emerging\
  \ trend within the historiography aims to advance an understanding of the conflict\
  \ that foregrounds IRA flexibility, as juxtaposed to British intransigence. On this\
  \ reading, it was the British refusal to engage in dialogue and offer the IRA an\
  \ \u2018honourable\u2019 settlement that prevented a peaceful resolution as far\
  \ back as the early 1970s; conversely, it was the British decision to shift course\
  \ in the late 1980s that paved the way for peace. The problem, however, is that\
  \ such a narrative represents a fundamental misreading of what happened. For this\
  \ reason, the present article examines several recent, important contributions to\
  \ the literature on the IRA and the peace process, as part of an effort to revisit\
  \ the question of why it was that the IRA decided eventually to end its self-declared\
  \ \u2018long war\u2019."
