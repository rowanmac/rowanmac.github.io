abstract: "Between 1621 and 1626, the soldier-historian Philip O\u2019Sullivan Beare\
  \ authored treatises to motivate Catholic powers toward greater intervention in\
  \ Ireland, and to defend his country\u2019s honor more generally. Moving beyond\
  \ political theology, the author\u2019s unfinished manuscript Zoilomastix incorporated\
  \ natural history and astronomy. The current article draws attention to a previously\
  \ overlooked fragment wherein the Irishman considered contemporary debates on the\
  \ structure of the heavens. It first considers the material history of the fragment,\
  \ before exploring the influence of continental pedagogic and military networks\
  \ upon the author. The paper then presents evidence of O\u2019Sullivan Beare\u2019\
  s adherence to Thomist, Bellarminian cosmology, and of his disagreement with Clavius\
  \ and Galileo, via Jacques du Chevreul\u2019s 1623 commentary on Sacrobosco\u2019\
  s Sphere. Contrasting the fragment\u2019s contents with the cosmogony published\
  \ in the author\u2019s Patritiana decas (1629), it demonstrates that these exegetic\
  \ readings were part of the author\u2019s wider strategy for \u201Cmaking truth\u201D\
  \ amidst shifting political, confessional, and cosmological paradigms."
