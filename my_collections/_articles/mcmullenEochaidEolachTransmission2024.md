abstractNote: "Following recent work that has begun to reassess previously held views\
  \ about the recensions of Dinds.enchas \xC9renn, this article examines the authorship\
  \ and transmission history of the dinds.enchas of Loch Garman, which exists in two\
  \ prose versions and one verse composition. We first argue that the verse dinds.hencas\
  \ of Loch Garman is the product of a single author, Eochaid \xC9olach \xFAa C\xE9\
  ir\xEDn, refuting Tom\xE1s \xD3 Concheanainn\u2019s assertion that Eochaid composed\
  \ only the second half of the poem. We then examine the individual versions of the\
  \ dinds.enchas of Loch Garman to posit a new relative chronology, with potential\
  \ ramifications for an understanding of the recensions of the Dinds.enchas."
