abstract: "This paper argues how postcolonial melancholia, as defined by Paul Gilroy,\
  \ haunts attempts within Belfast to use public art to move past the trauma from\
  \ the Troubles and colonialism\u2019s lingering impact. We begin by addressing the\
  \ history of political murals and re-imaging projects where public art is used to\
  \ soften Belfast\u2019s sectarian imagery. We then explore recent efforts by street\
  \ artists to re-image the city to make it more amenable to tourists and middle-class\
  \ patrons. We conclude with the reflections from promoters, artists, and graffiti\
  \ writers regarding the role of public art as they oscillate between acknowledging\
  \ the impossible task of art moving beyond historical trauma, political upheaval,\
  \ and colonialism and idealised notions of art. An overarching middle-class vision\
  \ of art and the neoliberal approaches of using it to bolster the city as a tourist\
  \ destination fit awkwardly within the postcolonial melancholia that continues to\
  \ trouble Belfast."
