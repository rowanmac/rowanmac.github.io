abstract: "This article examines Irish nationalist girl scouts in the period 1911\u2012\
  23 with a particular focus on the organisation Clan na Gael (or Clann na nGaedheal).\
  \ It illuminates the involvement of girls in Irish nationalist youth organisations\
  \ in the early twentieth century and situates them in the wider contexts of uniformed\
  \ youth groups and the Irish nationalist movement during this period. Like their\
  \ male counterparts in Na Fianna \xC9ireann, Irish nationalist girl scouts received\
  \ forms of military training and provided military support services to their adult\
  \ colleagues in the Irish independence movement. Thus, these Irish girls challenged\
  \ the gender conventions of the time more overtly than members of the international\
  \ Girl Guide movement. Participation in these groups could also serve as a conduit\
  \ to future membership and activism in Cumann na mBan or the Irish Citizen Army.\
  \ The contributions of Clan na Gael and other girl scouts to the Irish nationalist\
  \ movement demonstrate that girls, as well as boys, sought to further the struggle\
  \ for Irish independence. Yet, these adolescent female activists have received far\
  \ less recognition for their efforts. This may be due to their relatively small\
  \ numbers, dismissive preconceptions of their contribution, and the sparsity of\
  \ primary source material."
