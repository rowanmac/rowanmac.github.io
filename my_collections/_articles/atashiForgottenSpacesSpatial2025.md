abstract: Since the signing of the 1998 peace agreement, which marked the end of the
  violent conflict, Northern Ireland has remained largely stable. Once a hotbed of
  violence, Belfast has gone on to enjoy the benefits of peace, including urban regeneration,
  the emergence of an affluent middle class, economic development, increased job opportunities,
  and vibrant tourism. Yet in the same city, little has improved for those living
  in the most economically disadvantaged neighborhoods. These working-class areas
  bore the brunt of the conflict and continue to be excluded from the dividends of
  peace. The physical walls that separate communities reinforce memories of past hostilities
  and contribute to a sense of hopelessness about the future. Using Belfast as a case
  study, this article examines the spatial context of violence during the conflict
  and its role in shaping collective memory. It argues that post-conflict societies
  must address the persistent challenge of spatial inequality to fulfill the promises
  of peace.
