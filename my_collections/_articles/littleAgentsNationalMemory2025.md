abstract: "This article investigates how the role of archival texts as agents of memory\
  \ requires memory scholars to expand the concept of agency beyond human agency.\
  \ Revisiting Aguilar\u2019s and Budryt\u0117\u2019s concept of human individuals\
  \ as \u2018agents of memory\u2019, it draws on actor\u2013network theory, colonial\
  \ archive studies and book history to track the shifting \u2018memory capital\u2019\
  \ of forgotten archival texts. Taking as its case study the jail writings created\
  \ by female prisoners during the Irish Civil War, the article contends that taking\
  \ into account archival texts \u2013 as well as their creators \u2013 as agents\
  \ of memory can provide a richer understanding of how cultural memory is created,\
  \ stored, forgotten and \u2013 sometimes \u2013 reanimated in the wake of national\
  \ conflict."
