abstractNote: "Dutch society was taken aback by the onset of an apparently religious\
  \ war in Northern Ireland at the end of the 1960s. It responded by initiating community\
  \ holidays which they targeted at those children who were identified as being most\
  \ affected by the Troubles. These community holidays aimed to ameliorate \u2018\
  otherisation\u2019 by exposing Catholic and Protestant children to each other in\
  \ a neutral, peaceful setting. This study examines the context and operation of\
  \ these community holidays with a specific focus on three community holidays in\
  \ the Dutch province of Zeeland between 1973 and 1975, the first of which was organised\
  \ by Stichting Hulp Noord-Ierland (Foundation Help Northern Ireland, HUNI). The\
  \ success of this initiative in achieving its aim of reducing prejudice and thereby\
  \ future violence is assessed through a review of contemporary media material, organisational\
  \ archives and interviews with witnesses from both the Netherlands and Northern\
  \ Ireland. The success of the Dutch community holidays in achieving their aim of\
  \ reducing prejudice and thereby promoting peace is assessed through a review of\
  \ organisational archives and contemporary media material, alongside interviews\
  \ with witnesses from both the Netherlands and Northern Ireland."
