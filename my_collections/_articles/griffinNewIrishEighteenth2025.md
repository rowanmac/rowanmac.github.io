abstract: "Irish Literature in Transition is the first volume in a six-volume series\
  \ covering literature from 1700 to the present, which, according to a general opening\
  \ statement, aims to capture \u201Cthe dynamic energies transmitted over more than\
  \ 300 years of the established literary landmarks that constitute Irish literary\
  \ life.\u201D The goals of the series will strike as pertinent and wise to those\
  \ eighteenth-century scholars for whom the temporal, and indeed, cultural boundaries\
  \ of their chosen field have always been unstable and somewhat arbitrary, awkwardly\
  \ encompassing as they do a number of much-discussed transitions, from Restoration\
  \ to Augustan literatures, to literatures of Sensibility and Romanticism. Specifically\
  \ Irish evolutions are at issue in this volume, which very compellingly accounts\
  \ for linguistic, political, religious, philosophical, geographical, genre, and\
  \ gender ambiguities and transitions borne by the Irish eighteenth century, conceived\
  \ in the longest sense. The volume casts light upon new writers and streams of thought\
  \ until recently neglected in eighteenth-century and Irish studies."
