abstract: "The sources formally documenting how tax policy evolves fail to capture\
  \ many of the complexities inherent in such processes. Insights into such approaches\
  \ would guide other tax administrations in navigating tax policy change in an international\
  \ domain. This paper examines the historical background to the introduction of the\
  \ Irish 12.5 percent corporate tax rate in 2003 in the face of the European Union\u2019\
  s (EU) dissatisfaction with the existing regime. A low corporate tax rate has long\
  \ been seen as a critical element of the country\u2019s industrial development strategy.\
  \ Employing an oral history method to identify the perspectives and objectives of\
  \ those involved in the policymaking process, we provide a case study of how one\
  \ tax administration resolved what was seen as a particularly significant public\
  \ policy dilemma."
