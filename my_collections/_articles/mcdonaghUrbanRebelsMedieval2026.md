abstract: "The topic of urban revolt in medieval Ireland has been overlooked by wider\
  \ scholarship. This article offers the first detailed analysis of a revolt which\
  \ occurred in Galway in the late fourteenth century. The basis of this study is\
  \ a twentieth-century transcription made of an extract from a plea roll of the king\u2019\
  s bench in Ireland before the latter\u2019s destruction in 1922, which records the\
  \ judicial proceedings taken against one of the town\u2019s rebels and provides\
  \ an under-exploited (and not entirely reliable) narrative of the key facts of this\
  \ rebellion. This article locates the actions of Galway townspeople within a wider\
  \ European pattern of protest and rebellion in the second half of the fourteenth\
  \ century and, more specifically, places the revolt in the context of contemporary\
  \ political events in Ireland and England. The events in Galway should be viewed\
  \ as a genuinely \u2018popular\u2019 revolt, challenging assumptions about the presumed\
  \ loyalty of towns and cities in medieval Ireland to the English crown and its local\
  \ representatives."
