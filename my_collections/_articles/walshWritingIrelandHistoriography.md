abstract: 'History of education scholarship in the Republic of Ireland has witnessed
  a blossoming in recent years, a trajectory which diverges from broader international
  patterns. Expanding beyond its traditional focus on teacher education, recent scholarship
  has extended its theoretical, methodological and thematic foundations. This article
  traces the contours of the historiography of Irish education, highlighting dominant
  themes and intellectual trends. Focusing in particular on research relating to the
  period 1831 to 1975, it maps the scholarship across five inter-related motifs: the
  massification and democratisation of education; control and governance; gender;
  curriculum; and teachers and teacher education. Acknowledging there remain significant
  lacunae, in particular in relation to race and sexuality, we offer in the conclusion
  some suggestions for future avenues of research.'
