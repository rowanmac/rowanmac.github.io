abstract: "This article traces the contours of the history of women\u2019s education\
  \ in England and Ireland in the period 1850-2000, mapping dominant themes and key\
  \ inflection points. Positing a framework for reading degrees of change over time,\
  \ we propose four interrelated lenses: access, curriculum, institutional presence,\
  \ and networks. Drawing on key contributions to the field, we argue that women\u2019\
  s engagement with higher education has followed a complex and uneven trajectory,\
  \ reflective of the shifting sands of attitudes and accommodations toward women\
  \ across time, space, and discipline."
