abstractNote: "Analogue and digital simulations have been used in conjunction with\
  \ other pedagogical approaches and practices for decades now as research continues\
  \ to evince the positive influence that they have on learning and social interaction.\
  \ There is a wealth of historical games that aim to immerse players in a variety\
  \ of era-defining epochs, with varying levels of abstraction and narrative arcs.\
  \ However, there appears to be a dearth of games that focus on past events that\
  \ are deemed too disturbing, too divisive, or too recent, especially those that\
  \ occurred in an urban setting. Additionally, the geopolitics \u2013 if any \u2013\
  \ are backgrounded, as are the socio-economic structures of the people and places\
  \ being represented. So, what contexts should we not model or simulate? What stories\
  \ cannot \u2013 or should not \u2013 be told through this medium? And when is a\
  \ historical period \u2018too soon\u2019 to be approached \u2013 especially when\
  \ a simulation, a mere \u2018game\u2019, is the method of examination something\
  \ so recent, so distressing as the Troubles of Northern Ireland? This article introduces\
  \ the table-top narrative-based simulation, The Troubles,1 scheduled for publication\
  \ by Compass Games LLC, to demonstrate that there is space for such titles designed\
  \ with clear pedagogical aims and objectives, which augment the popular genre of\
  \ historical gaming \u2013 historical wargaming in particular \u2013 and that there\
  \ is much to benefit from simulations of this type which are interdisciplinary in\
  \ nature, encompassing academic disciplines such as politics, history, languages,\
  \ and ethics."
