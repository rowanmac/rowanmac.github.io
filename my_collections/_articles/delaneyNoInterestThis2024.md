abstractNote: "Following its creation, the Irish Free State took steps to assert itself\
  \ from the United Kingdom in the area of foreign policy. While a notable success\
  \ was joining the League of Nations, another key moment presented itself in the\
  \ form of the Treaty of Lausanne and discussions regarding its ratification by the\
  \ Irish government. While this accord concerned the Allied Powers of World War One\
  \ and the entity we now know as Turkey, talks regarding its approval by Dublin had\
  \ far-reaching consequences, on the right of dominions to refuse calls to arms from\
  \ London and touched upon the issuing of Irish passports, which distinguished between\
  \ British subjects and Irish citizens. Indeed, discussions in the D\xE1il and Seanad\
  \ to approve this treaty would also play a role in British approval for the appointment\
  \ of an Irish Plenipotentiary in Washington DC, the first British Dominion to do\
  \ so."
