abstract: "By examining how Irish racial attitudes intersected with national and cultural\
  \ identity, this article dismantles the idea that conceptions of race and racism\
  \ are somehow peripheral or irrelevant to the nation's social history. Outlining\
  \ a series of racialised incidents perpetrated against overseas students in mid-twentieth-century\
  \ Ireland, it explains how attitudes to newcomers and ethnic \u2018others\u2019\
  \ can shed new light on post-independence national identity. By highlighting these\
  \ distinctive aspects of national discourse, this article begins incorporating Irish\
  \ understandings of race and diversity into the overwhelmingly white field of Irish\
  \ history. It also adds an Irish perspective to a growing body of literature on\
  \ race in predominantly white societies and challenges scholars to consider how\
  \ conceptions of history, culture and identity fostered social inclusion and exclusion\
  \ and conditioned attitudes to national and ethnic outsiders."
