abstractNote: "We use the universe of probate and vital registers from England between\
  \ 1838 and 2018 to document the status of the Irish in England. We identify the\
  \ \u201CIrish\u201D in the records as those individuals with distinctively Irish\
  \ surnames. From at least the mid-nineteenth century to 2018, we find that the Irish\
  \ in England have persisted as an underclass, being on average 50 percent poorer\
  \ than the English. Infant mortality was about 25 percent higher for the Irish between\
  \ the 1830s and the mid-twentieth century but has subsequently equalized. Sorting,\
  \ both to urban areas and to the North of England, are important elements in the\
  \ Irish experience. We discuss the potential roles of selective migration, social\
  \ mobility, and discrimination in this and signpost directions for future research."
