abstract: "Sir Richard John Griffith was the acknowledged \u2018father of Irish geology\u2019\
  \ and his fossil collection was without doubt the single most valuable and important\
  \ Irish palaeontological collection to be assembled by any individual in the nineteenth\
  \ century. Being one of the earliest collections to be used for systematic descriptions\
  \ of Paleozoic fossils it held the type material for over five hundred species and\
  \ twenty-eight genera that were new to science. The original work on the collection\
  \ was by Frederick McCoy who produced two volumes describing the collection in 1844\
  \ and 1846. Most surviving specimens are in the National Museum of Ireland \u2013\
  \ Natural History, with other important holdings in the Sedgwick Museum in Cambridge,\
  \ and Trinity College Dublin."
