abstract: This article examines how the Catholic Church, working hand in glove with
  the Irish State, used the education system in order to regulate Irish sexuality
  in the early decades of Irish independence. Through an analysis of a range of primary
  sources, interwoven with oral testimony, it argues that the dominance exercised
  by the Catholic Church in the organisational culture of schools, its control over
  the training of teachers and its suppression of a sex education curriculum, all
  contributed significantly to the regulation of sexuality in the period under review.
