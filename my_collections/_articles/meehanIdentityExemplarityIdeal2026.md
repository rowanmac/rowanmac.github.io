abstract: "This article examines some early medieval Insular texts on the ideal king:\
  \ three examples of Old Irish tecosca (wisdom) texts and the ninth section of the\
  \ Latin De XII abusivis (\u2018On the twelve abuses\u2019). These texts are collectively\
  \ much studied, but largely from a perspective of the ideology of rulership they\
  \ espouse, be it Christian, pre-Christian or secular. This contribution takes an\
  \ alternative perspective, underlining the techniques the authors used to construct\
  \ a common elite identity, encompassing both rulers and other lay and clerical elites."
