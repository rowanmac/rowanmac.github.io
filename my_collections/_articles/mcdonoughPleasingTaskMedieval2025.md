abstract: ', abstract:, The Dublin penny journal, the Irish penny journal, and the
  Irish penny magazine were weekly periodicals circulated in Ireland during the 1830s
  and 1840s. These penny publications intended to bring to a wider audience matters
  of Irish history, legend, topography, and discussions around Irish identity. As
  these publications were edited by antiquarians for much of their runs, a large amount
  of antiquarian research was published in their pages. This article explores how
  topics pertaining to medieval Irish literature are presented in these publications,
  given that they were aimed at a non-scholarly audience. These publications were
  linked to the promotion of a national idea and this article examines how the medieval
  texts selected for publication aided this aim in promoting a long literary past
  centred around the Irish language.'
