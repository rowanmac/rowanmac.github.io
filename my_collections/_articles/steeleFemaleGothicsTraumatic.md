abstract: "This article explores Rosamond Jacob\u2019s The Troubled House (1938) and\
  \ Dorothy Macardle\u2019s The Uninvited (1942), two works of fiction that employ\
  \ a gothic aesthetic to confront readers with the failings of a republican movement\
  \ to which they had actively contributed. If providing distinctive perspectives\
  \ on revolution, war, and nation-building, both novels similarly employ the gothic\
  \ to draw our attention to the pathology of venerating motherhood while ignoring\
  \ the complex realities of Irish women\u2019s lives. Read together, The Troubled\
  \ House and The Uninvited exemplify the fruitful ways that a gothic aesthetic can\
  \ simultaneously elicit a broad readership while delivering a dissident message\
  \ that many readers would not otherwise wish to hear."
