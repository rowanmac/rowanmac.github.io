abstract: "This article revisits Jonathan Swift\u2019s Proposal for the Universal\
  \ Use of Irish Manufacture (1720) and seeks to place it within the context of the\
  \ debates surrounding the proposed establishment of an Irish national bank in 1720.\
  \ It shows how Swift\u2019s discussion of the ills facing the Irish economy might\
  \ be placed in conversation with the projects for a bank. In doing so it both takes\
  \ Swift\u2019s commentary on the bank seriously and speculates that it may have\
  \ been an addendum to the original text of the pamphlet. Engaging with recent Swift\
  \ scholarship and the literature on the bank it shows how the dean\u2019s arguments\
  \ fitted into wider arguments and the economic future of a dependent province and\
  \ how these debates were fundamentally shaped and reshaped by the wider context\
  \ of the South Sea Bubble."
