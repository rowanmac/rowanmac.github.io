abstract: "This paper details the background to proposals of the Irish Department\
  \ of Education in 1974 to introduce a new school subject entitled \u201CIrish Studies\u201D\
  \ to complement rather than replace the long-standing Irish language and literature\
  \ courses that the authorities of all post-primary schools had to ensure were taught\
  \ from 1922. From studying both areas, it was argued, students would develop a more\
  \ inclusive notion of Irish identity than had hitherto been promoted through the\
  \ education system. However, subsequent developments were maintained only for about\
  \ five years. That outcome meant that an opportunity was lost between then and the\
  \ present day for preparing Irish citizens to be able to contest xenophobic expressions\
  \ of Irish nationalism based on discredited interpretations of Irish history."
