abstract: 'This article examines British propaganda policy in Northern Ireland from
  1969 to 1982. In contrast with largely successful and routine coercive efforts to
  counter insurgencies in British colonies, tried and tested propaganda initiatives
  presented British governments with a Northern Ireland problem: how to respond to
  civil unrest and an armed insurgent movement close to the centre of power when subject
  to legal and media scrutiny. The proximity of Northern Ireland and the affinity
  of its dominant constituency of unionists, loyal to Britain, combined to hinder
  the transfer and application of otherwise seasoned strategies of propaganda and
  information warfare. The available archival records reveal how Britain''s benign
  neglect of escalating civil unrest in Northern Ireland precipitated a series of
  information failures, undermining the government''s attempts to secure the ''hearts
  and minds'' of a fractured population relegated to the perimeter of British government
  priorities.'
