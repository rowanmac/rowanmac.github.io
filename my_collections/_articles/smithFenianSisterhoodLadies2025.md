abstract: Through an examination of four newspapers of the nineteenth-century Irish
  press at home and abroad, this essay investigates the depiction of women within
  the dichotomy of the archetypes of proper women, who conformed to Victorian ideas
  of femininity, and reprobate woman, who did not. It argues that each paper characterized
  the ideal and reprobate woman based upon their overall ideology. All papers ascribed
  to traditional Victorian notions of femininity, regardless of their stance on nationalism
  or other issues, but the particulars differed.
