abstract: "Ireland\u2019s historical coordinates are shifting, prompting a re-examination\
  \ of national narratives and of the assumptions and anxieties that have kept them\
  \ in place. Increasingly, stories that disturb rather than coalesce with grand narratives\
  \ are the focus of historical study, revealing the structural violence used to maintain\
  \ societal order. This article argues that tending to bigger questions about power\
  \ and smaller ones about human experience creates space for new and diverse histories.\
  \ It explores the dynamics that shaped the grand narratives central to Irish history\
  \ and proposes the idea of imagined and lived encounters as a way of thinking about\
  \ differentiation, the relational nature of power and its impact on experience and\
  \ everyday life. An analysis of the concept of respectability is used to probe how\
  \ power functions. The article concludes with a consideration of the historical\
  \ archive broadly defined, highlighting the benefits of embracing the \u2018unreliable\u2019\
  \ witness, listening and accounting for silences, touching the material, and considering\
  \ imagination as a force constantly at play in the encounters that shape history.\
  \ The acceptance of this dynamic instability in historical research creates possibilities\
  \ for new voices and perspectives to emerge."
