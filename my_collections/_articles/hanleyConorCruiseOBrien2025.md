abstract: "This article examines Conor Cruise O\u2019Brien\u2019s ideas about historical\
  \ objectivity and the craft of the historian. Drawing on a mix of published material\
  \ and unpublished manuscript sources, it charts the evolution of the thinking of\
  \ a key Irish public intellectual about how historians should write history and\
  \ how their work should relate to their contemporary world. It identifies several\
  \ unacknowledged intellectual debts O\u2019Brien owed to influential twentieth-century\
  \ thinkers \u2014 namely, the philosophers Michael Oakeshott and Maurice Merleau-Ponty\
  \ and the sociologist C. Wright Mills. The article challenges the claim that O\u2019\
  Brien\u2019s view of historiography underwent significant changes in response to\
  \ the outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland during the late 1960s. On the contrary,\
  \ it is argued that O\u2019Brien\u2019s thinking on these themes remained fundamentally\
  \ unchanged from the mid 1950s until the end of his long career as a public intellectual."
