abstract: An examination of the history of menageries in Ireland from 1790 to 1840
  offers insights into how people related to and understood the animal world through
  exhibitions of exotic creatures. Menageries, featuring diverse collections of wild
  animals displayed in cages, were part of the broader entertainment scene at fairs
  and large social events in the early nineteenth century. Journeying across Ireland
  and Britain in horse-drawn caravans, these exhibitions evolved from modest attractions
  to significant commercial enterprises by the mid nineteenth century. While British
  menageries of the period have received considerable scholarly attention, Irish menageries
  have been largely overlooked. This article seeks to address that gap by exploring
  how the Irish public encountered exotic and rare animals in menageries during this
  period. Newspapers, advertisements for travelling menageries and contemporary accounts
  reveal that menageries played a meaningful role in bringing the wonders of the animal
  kingdom to the Irish populace, offering a glimpse into the exotic and the unknown.
