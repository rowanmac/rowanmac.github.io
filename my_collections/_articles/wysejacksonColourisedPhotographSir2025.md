abstract: "A colourised photographic portrait of Sir Richard John Griffith (1784\u2013\
  1878) dating from 1870 has been recently donated to the Geological Society of London.\
  \ It shows the sitter in a typical pose surrounded by items of geological interest,\
  \ including his Wollaston Medal and a geological map published in 1853. This is\
  \ a rare and hitherto undocumented portrait of this important Irish public servant\
  \ and geoscientist, and it and the various components depicted are described and\
  \ discussed here."
