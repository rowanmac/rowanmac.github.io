abstractNote: The Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood (FMDM) arrived
  in Ireland in 1942, to establish and run Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, county
  Galway. This was not without its challenges and this article explores many of those
  challenges in the context of the construction and management of the hospital between
  1942 and 1970. FMDM sisters were women in a patriarchal church and needed to also
  negotiate their place within the similar frameworks of the medical profession, civil
  service, and government, while being subject to gossip as to the work they were
  doing. The article is a revealing case-study of some of the global changes in medicine
  that had been taking place since the 1920s. It is also an example of how modern
  methods of healthcare were having an impact on the Irish healthcare system, with
  medically trained Catholic religious sisters at the forefront. The story of women
  religious in twentieth-century global Catholicism is a relatively unattended one.
  This case-study allows historians of religion to better understand the internationality
  of Catholic religious congregations, examining concepts of unity and disharmony,
  and the various efforts they made to confront but also comply with the patriarchal
  structures in which they found themselves.
