abstract: "In their 1988 critical edition of William Baldwin\u2019s comic prose satire\
  \ Beware the Cat (composed 1553; printed 1561), William Ringler and Michael Flachmann\
  \ assert that Baldwin (1526/7\u20131563) derived two anecdotes included in the work\
  \ directly from Topographia Hibernica, a twelfth-century survey of Ireland composed\
  \ by the well-travelled churchman and historian Gerald of Wales (Giraldus Cambrensis).1\
  \ The anecdotes are related during a fireside discussion that the work\u2019s principal\
  \ character, Gregory Streamer, recalls having with various men at the Aldersgate\
  \ residence of the prominent London printer John Day (d. 1584).2 Streamer, who was\
  \ lodging with Day, remarks to those around him on the great noise he heard cats\
  \ making atop the London wall on the previous night. Streamer\u2019s remark leads\
  \ the company into a discussion of whether or not animals have rational understanding.3\
  \ One of those present recalls being told of a cat that spoke in English to a man\
  \ in Staffordshire. Another member of the group, named Thomas, then relates a tale\
  \ he had heard in Ireland of a mysterious cat that asked two men for food in Gaelic\
  \ and proceeded thereafter to eat in their entirety a sheep and a cow."
