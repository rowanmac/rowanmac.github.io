abstract: "This article examines Catholic architecture in Ireland prior to the passage\
  \ of An act for the relief of His Majesty's Roman Catholic subjects (10 Geo IV,\
  \ c. 7), popularly known as the Act of Emancipation, in 1829. It focuses on one\
  \ case study building \u2014 the chapel, now church, of St John the Baptist in Cashel,\
  \ County Tipperary. Bringing together a range of documentary and visual sources,\
  \ this building is analysed according to its site, its specific architectural stylistic\
  \ features, and in relation to the social and liturgical contexts for its development.\
  \ The article contributes to the ongoing reassessment of the impact of the penal\
  \ laws and the varied experiences of Catholics through the late eighteenth-century\
  \ period of relief and reform, through its spatial, formal and contextual close\
  \ reading of one hitherto overlooked building. In doing so, it deepens understanding\
  \ of how architecture was used as a statement of civic identity and political intention\
  \ by Catholics of status and means. It also contributes to contemporary understandings\
  \ of regional classicism and to the specific meaning of ecclesiastical architectural\
  \ style in late-eighteenth-century Ireland across denominations. Finally, this article\
  \ considers the treatment and \u2018strategic forgetting\u2019 of this period of\
  \ pre-1829 Catholic building activity during the era of grand architectural expansion\
  \ at the end of the nineteenth century."
