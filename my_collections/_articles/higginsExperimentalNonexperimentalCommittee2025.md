abstract: "This article examines the Dublin House of Industry in the final decades\
  \ of the eighteenth century. Established in 1773, the House of Industry was part\
  \ of an effort to launch a nationwide system of workhouses and something like a\
  \ poor law system for Ireland. By the 1790s however, there was a shift from the\
  \ paternalistic governance of the founders of the house to a new way of managing\
  \ the relief of the poor within the institution. During this decade, there emerged\
  \ a new board of governors who adopted a supposed \u2018scientific\u2019 approach\
  \ to philanthropy. Influenced by the ideas of such workhouse reformers as Count\
  \ Rumford in Munich, the new governors attempted to enact a sweeping series of changes\
  \ to transform life in the workhouse along \u2018oeconomical\u2019 lines. It argues\
  \ that these transformations reflected broader patterns of social change in the\
  \ capital, as well as shifts in attitudes to poor relief more generally."
