abstractNote: "This article explores the grassroots peacebuilding approaches of women\
  \ in Northern Ireland (NI), focusing on their compassionate and transversal strategies\
  \ within a deeply patriarchal and conflict-ridden context. Drawing from fifteen\
  \ semi-structured interviews with women involved in Peace People and other organisations,\
  \ the study highlights how these women navigated ethnic identity politics and militarism\
  \ to promote inclusive peace initiatives. Using Elisabeth Porter\u2019s concept\
  \ of the Politics of Compassion as a framework, the research illustrates how solidarity\
  \ and empathy served as powerful political tools for these peacebuilders, enabling\
  \ them to transcend gendered divisions and challenge prevailing power structures.\
  \ Additionally, the article examines Transversal Politics, demonstrating how grassroots\
  \ women skilfully navigated conflicting identities and differences to foster diversity\
  \ and inclusion. The research further explicates how these efforts not only questioned\
  \ gender-based sectarianism but also illuminated the role of non-violent activism\
  \ rooted in compassion and justice."
