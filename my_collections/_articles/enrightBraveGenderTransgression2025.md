abstract: "Using newspaper coverage of women's and girl's property offences in minor\
  \ English and Irish courts, I analyze courts\u2019 use of Catholic convent institutions\
  \ between 1930 and 1959. Coverage of minor local hearings offers access to everyday\
  \ cases, where boundaries between moral and legal transgression were blurred. I\
  \ explore three interlocking themes in newspaper reports. First, those courts sent\
  \ to convents were punished, at least in part, for breaching prevailing gendered\
  \ moral norms. Second, judges represented convents as sites of moral reform; justifying\
  \ convent detention by reinforcing gendered notions of damaged female agency. Finally,\
  \ judges sent women and girls to convents even when they publicly resisted. In these\
  \ ways, courts reinforced reliance on convents for gendered \u201Cmoral reclamation.\u201D\
  \ In the conclusion, I explore the argument's implications for state reckoning with\
  \ historical abuses in institutions like Ireland's Magdalene laundries, showing\
  \ how abolition feminist legal histories can pose new questions about relationships\
  \ between law and the experience of mass incarceration."
