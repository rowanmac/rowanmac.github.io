abstract: "Did the Gaels of late medieval Scotland and Ireland conceptualise themselves\
  \ as a distinctive polity? Steven Ellis argued in 1999 that modern historians have\
  \ imposed Scotland and Ireland retrospectively and anachronistically upon what was,\
  \ in fact, a unitary late-medieval Gaelic world, or \u2018Greater Gaeldom\u2019\
  .\xB9 A companion article to this paper investigates this thesis with regard to\
  \ identity and culture.\xB2 The focus here is political, commencing with a brief\
  \ discussion of Scottish realpolitik before turning to Gaelic political thought.\
  \ It builds upon the foundational studies by M\xEDche\xE1l \xD3 Mainn\xEDn, Wilson\
  \ McLeod and P\xEDa Coira, drawing like them upon Gaelic poetry, over-whelmingly"
