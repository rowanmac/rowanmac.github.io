abstract: "The poem \u2018\xC9istibh a lucht an tigh-se\u2019 (hereafter \u2018\xC9\
  istibh\u2019) is contained in the <em>Book of the Dean of Lismore</em> (hereafter\
  \ BDL), a sixteenth-century anthology whose folios include the earliest surviving\
  \ collection of Gaelic verse in Scotland. From internal evidence, it seems the BDL\
  \ was compiled in Fortingall in Highland Perthshire between 1512 and 1526 by Dean\
  \ S\xE9amus Mac Groigair and his brother Donnchadh \\[Duncan],\xB9 with patronage\
  \ and participation of the local nobility and their networks, foremost of whom were\
  \ the Caimbeulaich of Argyll and Glenorchy.\xB2 However, the idea for the project\
  \ was almost certainly developed before the compilation started in"
