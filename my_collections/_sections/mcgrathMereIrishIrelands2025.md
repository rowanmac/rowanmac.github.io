abstract: "Medieval and early modern Irish parliaments and towns have historically\
  \ been seen as quintessentially English institutions which existed almost exclusively\
  \ for an Anglophone colonial community, although Brendan Bradshaw warned against\
  \ this reading:\xB9  One of the accepted truisms of sixteenth-century Irish historiography\
  \ concerns the attitude of the Anglo-Irish of the Pale and of the towns towards\
  \ the Gaelic Irish [which was characterised as being] set in a mould of colonial\
  \ contempt and hostility \u2026 The psychological block seems to exist in the mind\
  \ of the modern historian, rather than in the contemporary Anglo-Irish community.\
  \ The evidence overwhelmingly shows a high degree"
