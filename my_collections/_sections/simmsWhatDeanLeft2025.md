abstract: "In the course of compiling my electronic catalogue of extant bardic poetry,\
  \ which was focussed originally on the period 1200\u20131631,\xB9 I identified nineteen\
  \ poems (listed in the appendix to this paper) as associated with Scottish patrons\
  \ or authors but not forming part of that great anthology of medieval and early\
  \ sixteenth-century Scottish poetry known as the Book of the Dean of Lismore.\xB2\
  \ Subsequently, Professor Wilson McLeod very kindly drew my attention to two further\
  \ examples listed below as nos 20 and 21 but not appearing on the web version of\
  \ the electronic catalogue. The list comprises mostly well-known texts,"
