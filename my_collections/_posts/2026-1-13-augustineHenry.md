*Pdf copy of my MPhil Dissertation, a study of the work of Irish botanist Augustine Henry during his time in Yunnan, China. Mediocre stuff with a couple of worthwhile paragraphs. Too lazy to reformat it for web viewing at the moment. Might get around to that later. PDF [here](/assets/files/mastersDissertation.pdf).*
