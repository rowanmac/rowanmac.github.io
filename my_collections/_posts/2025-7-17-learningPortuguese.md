I've been listening to a lot of Brazilian music recently and this has sparked a desire in me to learn Portuguese, although its not relevant to anything else I am doing at the moment, I have never had the impulse control to dam the rising tide of impulsive passion which I suffer from roughly twice a year, toward a new language, and so when I saw a Portuguese copy of *The Stone Raft* (*A jangada de pedra*) by Jos√© Saramago in Hodges Figgis, I couldn't stop myself from buying it. Whether I will actually justify this purchase by reading the book cover to cover I can't say, but the seed of interest is planted, the grammar book pdfs are downloaded, and maybe I can water this little sprout from time to time.
