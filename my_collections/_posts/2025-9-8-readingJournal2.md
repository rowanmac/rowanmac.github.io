Reading much the same as I did last entry. Finished *Three Men in a Boat*, *Born Under Saturn* and *Swann’s Way*. *Saturn* is a lovely book, simply constructed, really well written and not prone to argument. It persuades by piling anecdote upon anecdote, to a nice overall effect. *Swann's Way* was fantastic and have started at *Within a Budding Grove*, although progress has been slow as I try to disentangle myself from Apple Books and port my digital library over to Zotero in anticipation of the iOS release of its ePub reader.

Have tried not to start anything new before I fly to Shanghai in a few days. But could not help myself, and bought a nice edition of Isaiah Berlin's *The Hedgehog and the Fox*, read half of it, and will try to read the other half on my last visit home. Have also started reading Zhāng Jié's 张洁 *Leaden Wings 沉重的翅膀* in Chinese using the Pleco reader which has been a surprisingly smooth experience. My Chinese reading has improved even if not much else has.
